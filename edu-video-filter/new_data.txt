This is just as good for adults as for kids. It combines incredible illustrations with stunning real life photography. And the book is seen and unseen all about the Japanese American incarceration during World War II, and the photographs that were taken of that time period and those events. It is stunning.

And it's so important to do that because if not, we're just talking past each other. So there's a lot of different ways to define racism. The shorthand definition I like is prejudice plus power. So I think we kind of understand the prejudice part. It's not liking someone based on their appearance, their skin color, their race, or ethnicity. And anybody of any race or ethnicity can be prejudiced, but it's power too. So prejudice plus power means that you can put your prejudice into policy. You can make rules and laws and structure society around your prejudice. And in that sense, racism is not something that everybody can enact. That is something that white people who have that power to put their prejudice into policy enact. And so that's a helpful kind of distinction as we think about prejudice and then the combination of prejudice plus power.

The garden was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Junior who apprentice under his world famous father. Construction started in 1925 and completed in 19 28. Many gifts were given to the garden including boxwoods from George Washington's Hayfield Manor. Here's the baptismal font. It's from the 9th century and is surrounded by and flowers that would have been used during that period. The cathedral is located in Cleveland Park which was so named because President Grover Cleveland had a summer house here called Oakview. The timber and stone used for this gazebo or shadow house as it's called was salvaged from Oakview when it was demolished in nineteen twenty-seven. All of the garden's flora is historically, religiously, or locally significant. Throughout the garden, you'll see many stone carvings. Most of which are from the 14th and fifteenth trees.

A priori, vous vous attendez à fouiller un site intéressant, mais pas non plus à découvrir grand-chose. Sauf si vous avez beaucoup de chance. C'est ce qui est arrivé à des étudiants d'une université allemande qui sont partis fouiller une église et qui ont fait une découverte étonnante et exceptionnelle. Il s'agit d'un cadran solaire en bois et en bronze qui date de la fin du Moyen-Âge. La particularité de ce cadran solaire, c'est qu'il fait la taille d'une boîte d'allumettes. Cette découverte aurait appartenu à une communauté religieuse appelée Frères et Sœurs de la Vie Commune, un mouvement chrétien fondé au XIVe siècle par un catholique néerlandais. Et des membres de cette communauté ont vécu dans l'ancien bâtiment du monastère. La découverte est incroyable parce qu'il reste très peu de cadrans solaires en bon état qui datent de cette époque, mais aussi parce qu'il s'agit d'un cadre de poche équipé d'un petit trou permettant de recevoir le morceau de bois qui marque l'ombre du soleil. Finalement c'est un peu la montre avant l'heure quoi.

It's actually a circoat dating from the very early half of the 19th century and it's a coronation circoat because it's red velvet and so it would have been worn under coronation robes. So inside, it's got the maker's label, William Webb, robe maker to his majesty and this means it was either worn at the coronation of George the fourth in 1821 or the coronation of William the fourth 10 years later. But the length gives it away a little bit and enables us to sort of narrow our deductions. Over time, the fashions change and actually circulates became a lot shorter and in the collection, we have another circoat exactly the same more or less although it's slightly shorter. It sort of measures just to stand here. And so from this, we can deduce that the shorter one was worn to William the fourth's coronation and the longer one was worn to George the fourth's earlier coronation. And if that's the case, then it was worn by the fifteen Frenchman but I always think that wearing this underneath is Coronation Roots must have got a little bit toasty.

Because stretchmarks are naturally one of the most nasty things you can have. So please don't show them. We would hate that for you for our precious eyes as society. Please pack them away. Be ashamed. Other people don't have them. It's only you love. Only you. Have you ever heard similar words to that even though I may have added a bit to them? Perhaps you read them in magazines when you were a teen, a child, or even an adult. Perhaps you remember, like I do, that in the 2thousands, stretchmarks were only truly mentioned in culture if it was because someone claimed to have finally found the true cure. It was an oil, a scrub, a little machine with electric pulses to soften your skin. And none of them worked other than taking away your money from your account and putting it into theirs. Today we're talking about stretchmarks and why it is that we have been feeling ashamed of them for so very long. Welcome to feminist Friday with me Camilla. I have an academic background in religion, intellectual history, Hebrew and feminist studies and I do this series called feminist Fridays to shed more light on the parts of history we normally don't hear very much about. If you like this and what I do, please leave this video a like and please go support my work on coffee so I can continue doing it. There's a link to the coffee where you can become a member of my hexacamic oven where you normally find those links. It's only three euros a month and it truly would make a difference for me so thanks for doing it. In this video I will be talking about stretchmarks and I will in regards to this talk about pregnancy. Please keep in mind that pregnancy is a thing that happens to those who have a uterus and that having a uterus does not mean you view yourself as a so called woman. If I say something about a pregnant woman in this video refer to what I am saying now. There are more than two genders there always have been so keep that in mind. And with that being said I think we should get right back to the topic of today stretchmarks or as some people like to call them let's talk about angel scratches. Angel scratches or stretchmarks is what happens when your skin is being stretched. They are a form of scars that occur when your body tears during rapid growth. They can typically be when you hit puberty or you fall pregnant or when you gain weight. I personally have stretchmarks from when I hit puberty on my breasts since I went from being a no-breasted individual to having a C cup within such a short time frame that the skin, it simply could not keep up and those stretchmarks in particular have always, always fill me with so much shame that I'm even ashamed of mentioning them right now which is exactly why I'm forcing myself to mention them because why on earth am I ashamed it's my skin it has lines you can see them so what the shame around stretchmarks is not a new phenomenon and I am even though this thought makes me sad I'm sure you know the shame too on some level because it is one we have been fed for long. Let's go back to ancient Egypt for example and see how they thought of stretchmarks. Of course I cannot ask anyone from the time so instead I have found sources saying that we have archaeological finds of little jars shaped like nude women that would have held ointment for the women who were pregnant. This ointment was for their growing bellies because those typically get stretchmarks during pregnant see. Actually, 90% of all pregnant bellies get stretchmarks in the process which then makes it even more ridiculous to see that there are more than 15 million hits on Google when you type in how to get rid of stretchmarks because one can deduce that people want to get rid of them because they do not like them. So, we do not like a very natural thing about ourselves. Why? Some think that a reason for this can be found in history because they think that skin conditions could be used as health indicators. Think of skin turning white when you are sick or for example if you get a rash. You can without being a doctor see that this person is one you shall keep a distance from until they are better in order for yourself not to be infected with whatever they may have. Well that can be a reason. But another one could maybe be found somewhere else. In capitalism. Let's take a look at how many companies that claim to have formulas that can cure your stretchmarks. Just like an ancient Egypt, ointments are still a thing being catered to your mind as the one thing that can solve your insecurities. And if we think of this capitalist aspect as being part of the reason, well, then that leads us down an interesting lane. Imagine, you have a business with a product you like people to buy. Your product in this allegory is tomatoes. You sell them but people don't really buy them. They like them fine enough but your profit is way too low. Okay, so what do you do? Well, you try to make good ads, you make great discounts, bulk options and more but nothing really helps. Then one day, you see your neighbor's business. They also sell tomatoes and their business is thriving. What do they do? Well, they say that their tomatoes cure bad breaths. People hate smelling so they get the tomatoes to get rid of a problem that they relate to. Now remove the tomatoes, remove the bad breath, insert instead oil, lotion and your stretchmarks. If we are being told again and again by companies that their product can solve this issue well then at some point we consider that they're a thing an issue. Of course the method is not as simple as this but it does show that the shame we feel about something that happens to 90% of those of all pregnant to 70% of adolescent girls and 40% of adolescent boys. This is a statistic I have from us also. Please remember what I said about gender but it shows that it's not necessarily a natural shame. It has been placed within our minds. Now can that be said about all things we feel ashamed about? Yes. So why am I saying it? To remind you and myself that our skin is lovely just as it is. It protects us and keeps us safe. Sometimes it has us, sometimes not, and that is totally okay and wonderful. And with that said, I'm now going to, for the first time in my life, wear something that shows off my angel scratches on my breasts because one needs to walk the walk to talk the talk, right? If you like this feminist bride aid, remember to like the video, follow me and also please go to my coffee and become a member so you can help me out with a tiny amount every month. I would much appreciate it. Thank you for watching. May you too want to show off your stretchmarks and love yourself in the process. I know I will do the same. See you next week. Stay feminist.

Well, I have one more question that maybe you can answer while I'm on my way down the studio to the new set. Just what will this change mean to the channel two viewers who will still be watching this in black and white. Well, we think you'll see a big difference on black and white receivers. The new color cameras will give an improved monochrome picture and all our new color sets here in the studio were designed with that in mind. Take it away in full spectrum color.

For instance, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Department of Defense National Park Service. You can go through and you can look at this. You can zoom in super close on York County on New York City and you can see exactly what's owned by the government. As you can see the East Coast as well as the Midwest and the South. Basically, the government doesn't own any of it. Meanwhile, out west, the government basically owns all of it. There's a lot of benefits and a lot of negatives to the government owning this much land. For instance, cities and states not being able to get enough tax dollars because the federal government is not really paying them enough for that land. However, good benefits. For instance, Noah owns all of this over here on the coast, meaning that they can detect when hurricanes are going to happen. You can also see how much Alaska and Hawaii is owned by the federal government and it's really interesting to see. Are you East Coast or West Coast? Let me know.
C0nDnq7P6b2|||Portrait is possibly one of the best PR moves in history. It's a portrait of a woman named Charlotte Corday. And Charlotte Corde was arrested and eventually executed for a unaliving a man named Mora who wrote a paper called The Friend of the People that inflamed extremist revolutionary sentiment during the French Revolution. I'm Dana Schwartz. I have a podcast called Noble Blood. So if you want to know like everything about Charlotte Corday just go listen to that episode right now. But the TikTok version we can get to that Now, even though Charlotte Corday unalived a revolutionary leader, she wasn't actually a royalist. She wasn't pro-monarchy. She was also in favor of the French revolution. She was just a member of a more moderate revolutionary faction as opposed to the more extremist Jacobin who led what's now known as the reign of terror. But Charlotte was smart enough to know that if she succeeded in her mission, she would be arrested and probably executed and that the revolutionary propaganda machine would go into full and it did. The man she unalived, Murah, was portrayed as a martyr like in famous paintings like this by David. And the stories about Charlotte Corde came out almost immediately. Revolutionaries were talking about how she was a royalist, she was pro monarchy and how while she was waiting to see Murah, she went to get her hair powdered. Clearly, she's not a champion of the people if she's getting her hair powdered. The Jacoby knew that as a young, beautiful woman, Charlotte Corde would naturally arous

C0nYNqYMU6-|||Berlin there's these giant flag towers that look a lot like castles. Why? Well in World War two the Germans trying to defend Berlin built these giant flag towers to defend against the bombing runs. Why are they still around? Because they're made with an extremely large amount of concrete to be able to survive bombing runs. The allies tried to destroy a bunch of them and a lot of times it didn't work because they're super thick. So a lot of them just ended up being in parks or they got buried. Around Berlin there's a whole bunch of these hills. But almost all of them are man made using the rubble from Berlin as well as burying a lot of these flack towers and other defensive structures that they just couldn't destroy because it was such thick concrete. These things are super cool. However, now they're getting to be kind of dangerous because they're now coming up on 100 years old and they're really starting to fall apart now but not falling apart enough for them to be able to be destroyed but now that Berlin's been repaired so much, they can't just blow these things up in place. So, it kind of comes down like are you supposed to do with all these big giant bunkers? Ones like this kind of got buried but not all of them.

Two two hundred eleven million pounds of pecans and nearly a billion pounds of French fries. You can go and see all of the amounts that they have across the all the cold storage amounts of every product. For instance half a billion pounds of beef. These caves are massive. Here's a semi truck for reference. These giant cheese caves in Missouri have been storing these products and continue to do so. What's really funny is it's right next to the Craft Food Distribution Center. I'm not sure how much goes back and forth but I think it's a decent amount. If you guys remember the Area 51 Naruto run into Area fifty-1 to release the aliens, let's do the same thing but with cheese. So I'll go to Springfield, Missouri, dress up like rats and eat some of that cheese. Yum yum yum. This is a joke. If you had one point four billion pounds of cheese, what would you eat?
C0p0yGFJKRe|||Being a White House chef would be super hard. Besides the amount of background checks and all kinds of things like that, these guys are constantly getting followed by foreign government's secret agents and by our government secret agents. They have to undergo a whole bunch of training to see if people are following them and do counter surveillance and all kinds of spy stuff but then they also have to be cooking all day. On top of that, the responsibilities that these guys have to deal with, that they need to make sure that nothing happens the president's food and they have to do that across kitchens across the globe. These guys travel with the president to make sure that the food that's being prepared is being prepared properly and then often times, the chef of whatever random country goes, this one is was the president of the United States and they go, no. You don't get to determine that and then they pick one at random because that reduces the chances that anything could happen to the president's food. Also, these dudes have to go to different grocery stores across the Seaboard all the time. They can never go to the same grocery store twice because they need to make sure that they're getting ingredients that aren't being tampered with. If you got it directly from the source potentially a foreign adversary would be able to get at it. Whereas if you just go to a random Albertsons somewhere in Pennsylvania the chances that Russia could have touched it or any other country is basically none.

CrlsUq-rC6s|||Congrats, love, I hear you just got married. What's that? You lost all your rights? What rights, love? You did not have any to begin with. After all, you're a woman and the year is 1768. But let me tell you a wee secret. Can you keep it between the two of us? Okay, come closer. This way of looking at you womenfolk will not change legally until the 20th century and your great-granddaughters will still be affected by it in 2023. Isn't that wonderful? Women with no rights as it should be. Hello, friends, and welcome to Feminist Friday, my weekly feminist show that helps you understand why the heck the world is the way it is. My name is Camilla and I'm your host. Today, we are going to talk about a concept called coverture, which was a legal doctrine that governed women's rights and status in marriage for many, many centuries. It was introduced back in the year of our lady gods, 1068, and did not properly go away until the 1970s. In the eyes of the law, a woman was considered to be covered by her husband, meaning that her legal identity was subsumed into his upon marriage. The reason I'm equipped to talk about this is because of my background within intellectual history, religion studies, Hebrew, and feminist studies. So buckle up, love. We are going to learn something truly fucked. Coverture stripped women of many basic rights that we take for granted today. For example, a married woman could not enter into a contract on property or make decisions about her own body without her husband's permission. She could not vote or hold public office, and she had no legal standing in court. Her husband was responsible for all aspects of her life, and he had complete control over her property and her children. This system of coverture was deeply unjust and unequal, and it had profound implications for women's lives. For one thing, it meant that women were entirely dependent on their husbands for their financial security and social status. If a woman's husband died or abandoned her, she was left with nothing and had no means of supporting herself. This made women vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and it reinforced the idea that women were inferior to men and needed their protection. Are you enjoying this episode so far? Send a kind thought to my patrons on Ko-fi who monthly support Your Fave Feminist, and in return, get to choose an episode of Feminist Friday every month. They chose this one today, and if you want to choose the next, go join them now using the link you see on the screen. If you're more into tipping, then fear not. Send me a coin or two on PayPal. Thanks. The legacy of coverture can still be felt in our society today. Even though many of the legal barriers that women faced have been removed, women still face significant inequality in many areas of life. Women are still paid less than men for doing the same work, and they are underrepresented in positions of power and influence. Women are more likely to experience violence and harassment, and they are still expected to take on the majority of domestic and caregiving responsibilities. But why is that? Why do we still accept this? I think it is because we have grown a bit lazy. We feel like, oh, well, it's good enough. We aren't really suffering, so this is fine. But it's not. It's not fine. We need to change. We must recognize that the legacy of coverture still affects women's lives today, and we must fight against it. We must continue to demand equal pay for equal work, and we must support women in their efforts to achieve political and economic power. We must work to end violence against women and to promote gender equality in all areas of life. The more you and I know about our history, the more we understand why things are the way they are. And if we understand them, we can properly get rid of them. If we do not understand, we lose the ability to argue against them. Coverture shows us how deeply ingrained gender inequality is in our legal system and our social structures. The concept of that simple thing explains so much, doesn't it? Just think about it. What is something in your life that you suspect can have its roots in this old idea? Let me know down below. Thanks for being here today. I hope to see you again next week, and until then, take care, and remember, love, to stay feminist.

As I explain all in the first mix set up today. Part 1 of today's mix set. Mix sets, plural. But the first part. Explained it all. Hopefully y'all are having a good week. Figured I'd have some gaming footage alongside my mix sets for now on. Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2. Because I played that game. Zymelo.ECFM. Is what I call it. My mix sets. Just going through the episodes of the streams I did. I literally called them episodes. It was like a few episodes a week. Based on how big of a leap I saw my performance and who I was up against. During online matches. Against a lot of really good players. As I explained. I don't know why I talk so much about this game. I'll consider this an underground game. I know so many people probably don't know about it. To where. I wouldn't have taken this game as seriously. Until like I'd still like if I'm I'd stream footage right. But I mean like. To the point where I was like oh snap I have to stream this. And I'm gonna get good. Because I'm playing it I'm gonna get good. But now. I have to get good against people to where all my controllers broke in the process. I kept joking about that. Because I wasn't streaming for a few months because of that. After streaming for years. Not stream on Twitch. I mean I was streaming on my. Through just Instagram. First anyway. Instagram and YouTube. I literally got into Twitch because I broke all my controllers and couldn't stream for a while. And then by the time I get new controllers no more PlayStation 3. So I now I just choose to stream on Twitch as well. Like I would not have been doing streaming on Twitch probably. I'd eventually do it. But it had to happen immediately because now there's no PlayStation 3 so how. My fault. It was Fightcade but Fightcade would get recorded through Twitch. Because it's gonna record my computer screen like that's the whole. It's kind of funny that transitions can happen. Like it was supposed to happen like that. But I'm gonna go get another PlayStation. Okay. I. I was saying something I forgot what I was saying. Forgot the point I was trying to make. So I can't just re-enter. There's a reason I brought up the. Okay. I was saying. How hard things how hard people go online and like so that's pretty cool footage or whatever. I. It's what if someone played this game and they haven't played online and they saw what it looked like online. Or if they played online they'd probably watch as well because they'd be aware that there's just crazy stuff. Just how anybody would watch any game for entertainment. I didn't see that I didn't see any type of Dragon Ball anything footage for on a gaming console taken to. I've never seen it at a level as high as what I saw in. Raging Blast 2 online. I have any games that they'd be all crazy stuff and whatever. But like I've never seen like. The levels people take it to and then the thing is you have to get good to see higher levels. S-rank players weren't starting to go hard against me till the end of when all my controllers woke. I couldn't play anymore because I was getting good enough to not beat them. But I was starting to beat everybody under the S-rank players and then. If S-rank players didn't start what happened was I was talking about the theory of intensity and Street Fighter streams. A lot I spoke a lot about that. In different levels of it and how I'm wiring that idea into my text and how I'm trick so that like I'm making games every time I step on with every tech I use. Every I made up like eight different texts and spoke on all them during Street Fighter streams and actually was. I'd only even do them for a day. Then I come up with another idea based on what I was doing and just my understanding of stuff and stuff I'd seen going on and I'd apply that. Go back in the losing a bit or evenly match when I should be winning or losing and I end up. It always be like within the next two streams or within the next five streams. I start beating pretty much everybody else up against and I'd go up into C-rank or something like that. I learn a new tech and drop out of C-rank usually that is literally. I learned a new tech that I thought up in my brain and I'm getting in the C-rank within a few streams. Some of them it was like the same stream. Some of them it was like the same stream. It was like literally I'm like, oh, I'm going to try out some new tech today. See me playing a little bit different go up and rank that day. Literally. I was doing putting in time to make sure like of doing it. So that when I show up, I already had the games within a day. Like I hadn't even been practicing it for 24 hours. It went through a whole bunch of stuff like that. Stuff like that. I was on a tech that got me into C-rank and kept me there for a while that broke all my controllers again. So I had to go relearn directional arrow and then. But why did I bring that up? I was talking about tech. What was I referring to? Something about tech. Okay, because I was talking about intensity in games. And how I noticed in Street Fighter, Raging Blast 2, Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2. S-rank players. They seem easy. It felt like it was easy, but they'd never lost to me, right? But they seem easier the entire time until it was time for them to win at the end, basically. And I got came to this conclusion that because they're at such a high intensity. No one could see what intensity they're at unless you're near closer to their level. So I was talking about, oh, it feels so much harder. I'm going to the next video. I was talking about and it's clear footage of it. It was extremely harder to fight people near my rank. So if I'm rank G, someone who's F-rank, it almost seemed like the F-rank player could beat the S-rank player. It's just that the F-rank player could just utilize more of their skills against me. So the match was insanely more competitive. What happened was I'd be more likely to beat the F-rank player. Just never would yet because I'm just not was at that level of performing in the game yet. Computers freezing now. Should not be happening. There's no reason for this right now. And this should be playing the footage. Here's what's going on. It could be the internet out now. Could be the internet. Could be the internet. Which is alright because I can still stream whatever. I can still stream on my phone, but this is going on. I need to see that it's playing the correct video. Okay, it is. Sorry. Apologies for that detour. Resetting the video. Mix is still going. It's getting choppy now, which is weird. It's weird because I don't like it. There's no reason for this right now. Have to reset this again. We're only playing this footage once. I'll make sure it plays whatever. Oh my gosh. Excuse me, computer. Excuse me. This is a fail. This is a fail right here. This is a fail right here. Oh my gosh, this is a fail. How is this happening right now? How about this? Raging Blast 2 is discontinued until the next mix. Because we don't have time for this right now. And it shouldn't be skipping like this either. What's up with that? Watching anime. Closing out an entire internet window real quick. That it didn't need to be open. And if it's affecting this, how dare it? How dare it? And I'm not recording anything to my computer. So why is this skipping like this? It might be possible that I need to reset my... I'm hopping right back in the mix. Bear with me for a moment. Bear with me a moment. We're going to have to hop back into this. We're going to have to hop right back in. Because my computer is now trying to act like it can't function at all. Computer is trying to act like it won't function. Computer is trying to act like it won't function. During a live mix set. Oops. That can't be. Application is not responding. End process or wait. What are you referring to? So is this mix set here? No. I'm going to call that a mix set because of what just happened. I'll be back in another one. See y'all soon.

World of Warcraft season 3 starts tomorrow with Amir to Soul Dreams Hope also coming out as well as Mythic Plus season and whatnot. But what's really important about this is the race to World of First. All the top guilds for World of Warcraft are competing for who be able to defeat Faroc first. And when we have these events typically you have some casters that are commentating on what's happening on what these guilds are doing. To best efficiently strategize on how to be the person to claim that World First Kill. And with such I have an announcement to make. Today, I will actually be casting the Race to World First for Team Liquid. I cannot express enough how much gratitude I have for all the folks over at Team Liquid for allowing me to have this opportunity to cast today. If you guys would like to tune in to the broadcast, you can do so on Twitch. I feel the need to apologize for this but it generally just brings a big smile on my face. Look, they even did like a little graph thing that they posted on socials. Isn't that neat, dude? I'm so nervous.

This is my personal headset that I wear all the time. I'm also someone that gets migraines very easily. So weight and comfortability is a main priority of mine. Even the biggest pieces that I have they only weigh usually like a few ounces at the most. Nothing that I have weighs over a pound. Not even half a pound. I've been wearing my designs since before I started the shop so it's been over a year and I haven't had any issues. But I I hope this helps.

Я не знал до этого, что Jordan использует стриминговую площадку как официальный канал продаж. Это очень круто. Один из самых последних примеров Китая, это когда популярная блогерша за неделю продала на 18,7 миллионов долларов товар, просто транслируя это на прямом эфире за доли секунды. Это очень круто, что мировые бренды переходят и продают вот таким образом. Я думаю, что в нашей стране это дойдет уже в следующем году.

CsJRH8noIzn|||This is the Dell M16 Rone. The latest Alienware gaming laptop from Dell. Let's check it out. As all gaming laptop goes, this thing is heavy but boy does it look good while sitting. The RGV setup here is very well worth. Be it on the logo, on the back, on the edges or on the keyboard. It looks really nice. The 16 inch QHD plus panel has a max refresh rate of 165 hertz. It's really good. Be it watching content, playing games and just doing daily everyday tasks. For that matter supports Dolby vision and Dolby Atmos. It's pretty cool. The track pad here is huge and very responsive. But for gaming it's better to get yourself a mouse. You get an FHD webcam here which is decent. But if you are into gaming and streaming you better get yourself a third party webcam. You get plenty of connectivity options here. Multiple USB type A ports, USB type C port and even a card reader. Under the hood it's powered by 13 gen Intel core I-9 processor which is paired together with Nvidia G force RTX latest DPUs. This thing is extremely powerful. Other hardware specs into upgradeable DDR5 memory and also storage of up to nine TB SSD. Now I gotta go and they've got them. For more broader content follow Business Insider India.

Csm1CE5s8jd|||We just saw how some parents are learning to prioritize their mental health, but according to a report from the Mental Health America, more than 60% of young people with depression do not have access to mental health services. But students at Pomona High School are working to change the narrative. I took a look inside a classroom to see how a groundbreaking program is helping to save lives one student at a time. Whenever the feeling of anxiety crept up on Carmen Ayala, she often found herself helpless because at home caring for her mental health was not a priority. Growing up, she rarely was able to express her emotions to her family. Feelings that only grew stronger when she saw other students have a good relationship with their parents. In school, walking around seeing parents communicate effectively, seeing my friends be able to live a very understanding life as to where they trust their parent, their parent trusts them, etc. Carmen is a senior at Pomona High School. Three years ago, she joined the Student Peer Counseling Program. It provides an opportunity for students like her to help other students with their mental health challenges. Just recently, she was able to help support her fellow peer get through a dark time. You could tell she was very like on edge. And she kept on saying, I keep on hearing like voices in my head, like it's getting a little too much. So that was something that I really was like, you hear about that on TV, you hear about that, like, oh, people go through this, but you don't realize like students my age are going through this. Sheila Bach is the peer resource advisor at Pomona High School. She says students have to undergo a four month rigorous training where students learn how to role play, learn about confidentiality and attend a four hour student school sessions in order to get certified to be a peer counselor. We're very hands on. The kids provide a service. The service is when someone needs, you know, someone to listen to. We're there. In her over 26 years of teaching this class, Sheila has helped twelve hundred peer counselors who have helped thousands of students with their mental health. If I could, I would have every student on this campus take my class because it's not just for our immediate providing service on campus. This is life skills. But the even greater legacy for Sheila are students like Carmen. I want to be able to use what I've learned in this class, basically communication, validation, you know, questioning, empathy and sensitivity and bring that into the full light of kind of having the full circle of you figure out the problem. You figure out how to help your client and using the tools that Carmen has learned here to help guide others in their healing journey. Coming up, we discover how the Los Angeles LGBT Center has become a safe haven for seniors in the community. Stay with us.
B8_eBbLFzyt|||Namaste Rods and Mamas. Today I have a mindful parenting tip for you. If your child constantly is saying no and it totally is driving you cray-cray. So a couple months ago this was becoming a problem. Anytime I needed Ayaan to do a normal responsibility like taking off his shoes on time or brushing his teeth or taking a shower it was constantly met with no's and it was really getting infuriating and honestly when I noticed that I would get upset or angered by it the feeling underneath it was a feeling of rejection of not being heard and whenever I felt a little anxious or already short on time when I was trying to control the situation and he was saying no and I was being met with no it felt I took it personally and so I realized that saying no is a child's way of asserting their independence. The first thing I had to get really clear with is how often am I modeling saying no and when I got really honest with myself I was saying no more often than I'd like. So I've taught Ayaan and we have to teach our kids that no is important. No when there's a danger or a safety or a violation to your boundaries no means no and there is a specific place for you to say no. However when it is you know someone trying to help you and mommy and daddy are trying to move things along and we're going to turn into things with not responsibilities and there's no negotiation for those things that's when we don't say no right so we can certainly share our feelings maybe you're not ready to do it maybe you're feeling tired however you know these are the no's that I wanted to move past like the no's that I know we were just saying it to be defiant and to assert his independence but he knew that we should be doing it. So this is what I did I noticed that I was being too serious and whenever he would say no I would tense up I would take it personally and then it became a power struggle. So one day I decided instead of taking it personally and I said you know it's not something against me I was like oh my goodness there's so many no's today you know when I hear a lot of no's what happens to mommy? Mommy's tickle monster comes out and said and then I chased him around in here and said tell me no say no say no and then I said I can't stop until you say yes. So now whenever he would say like no like no I'm not changing my clothes I'd be like uh-oh I hear a lot of no's I gotta tickle them out of here so anytime you need them to cooperate about something that is what they're meant to do they have to do it this is a playful way to approach it don't take it personally make it playful connect with them touch them you know don't be so much in your agenda when you meet them at their late level you know they feel like you're not just trying to be in charge and nagging them and trying to tell them what to do nobody likes to be told what to do all the time and nobody likes to hear no all the time so I realized that I've really been working hard and I've I elicit Ayan's help that mommy's really trying hard not to say no when I don't really mean it and I noticed that I say it like whenever I'm like my mind is somewhere else and he's making a request my first instinct is to say no because that's like my boundary because it keeps me safe when I'm trying to keep things into control so just be mindful that I'm not saying that that's happening with you but maybe that might be and just be mindful bring your children into it like can you let me know when I'm mommy's saying no too much because then you can tickle me and that's what I tell you I was like mommy's saying no remember that she needs the tickle monster too so it's a fun and playful way of connecting and I find that you know sometimes Ayan really wants to keep doing it but we have a time limit and we have to get going and I need him to do like but that was so awesome I love tickling you but now it's time to do what we're supposed to do and I'm telling you guys once I've had that laughter and that connection he does not fight me on whatever it is to do a lot of times he like you know I'll walk away and he just goes and does whatever he needs to do that we were talking about so and if they feel like they're keep going and they just want to keep being playful playful and be like oh it's making mommy feel sad that you know we're gonna if the longer it takes you to go take your shower the less time that you're gonna have to play before dinner so you can just use the feelings of sadness instead of like feelings of disappointment or anger don't let it take it personal because the minute you take it personal there's gonna be a power struggle so be playful and try this out and let me know how it goes thanks so much for watching guys
CjinXEPvfLx|||If you're having a particularly bad day today, then stay with me now and let's work through this together. Everything you're experiencing in your body is your portal to freedom and peace. I know it doesn't feel like this right now and it can feel all-consuming, but the feeling itself is not why you're experiencing suffering, it's your aversion to allowing the fullness of the experience to take place in your body that is holding you in a place of resistance and therefore suffering. I know this feels like a lot, and it might be a lot, there might be a lot going on in your body right now, but just know that you are a lot. You are a lot of love, which also means that you are a lot of grief. You are a lot of happiness, which means that you will also experience a lot of sadness. It's part of the experience that we've come here to be involved in, in this 3D realm on planet Earth. But just know that if you can let in the full experience of, say, sadness, it means that the next time that you start to experience happiness, you will be able to, with all your heart, say yes and fully receive the experience of happiness in its totality and in its fullness. It's allowing our emotions to be felt that creates a fulfilling life.

C0eagpSMeuh|||It's me
C0N4_dpPihs|||Good morning people. Ah says what you see as a problem is actually a ah an opportunity to grow, to explore the solutions to be become better in life. Do you really think so? This is tidbitrama signing in. So as I said when I say problem so obviously I wanted to talk about the human trait of problem solving. Most of the people think problem solving is not a ah a trait or it's not a constructive ability. But yes to some extent they are they are right. It is not a skill it's actually a mindset where it will help us to look at the positive aspects or the solutions of a challenge or the problem we have at hand which has to be resolved. It will help us to evaluate various solutions and it will help us to what extent that every solution is possible and in a way it will also ah enable ah ah it will enable us to apply those solutions apply that solution because you cannot just implement every other idea comes into your mind right you should evaluate whatever suggestions or the ah solutions you have at hand may be in a team let's say if at all there is a issue everybody can suggest a different ah solution because every mind thinks different they so they have their own trait to ways of handling situations or the issues or the challenges. Whether it's in the personal or the professional life. So once even you resolve ah once when you evaluate all the solutions which are suggested or which are available or which ah through which you get some ideas you can implement a feasible solution. In the sense which is easy to implement. Whether it term it is in terms of fullness or whether it it is in terms of finance or whether it is in terms of duration like some solutions may take long term but we may not have that much time to resolve the issue some issues or some problem has to be resolved immediately may be in a months right may be in a week's time even time duration falls in the feasible ah ah what I can say feasible feasibility criteria so ah problem solving it helps in adaptable basically it will help us to look at various ah what are the positive aspects of the situation it won't help us to ah sulk in ah ah just thinking negatively about the problem or worry worrying about the problem it will help us to analyzing situation or adapt ourselves to the existing circumstances and then in a way when once we evaluate the feasibility and once we start implementing it will help us in making a good decision making, right? Whichever solution is feasible or whichever solution is more adaptable or implementable. It will also help us in decision making. Let's say for all the implemented solution is not giving a expected results or the result is very low. The positive result is very low. Then you can evaluate other solutions which are which are already analyzed or which are already or discuss whatever it the case may be. It will even help us to think innovatively while looking at the issue because once when you have a challenge you have to when you say solution obviously sometimes the existing solutions may not or the regular practice solutions may not work out or they might not be feasible. So obviously you have to think ah to resolve the issue in a creative way in a in in a noble way. So that it will help us to innovate or to check where what are the various ways that the ah challenge can be resolved and it will help us to be creative. And obviously in one of the videos where I we talked or we discussed about creativity. To create it doesn't simply mean artistic side of the human being. It actually relates to everything. Even if you talk about realistic or logical issues. Even creativity plays a vital role in that. Once you are thinking in a noble way or doing something in a noble way that itself is also a creativity that's also 11 act of creativity or one form of creativity so once we have this innovative and creative process to ah ah resolve the problem at hand we will be able to communicate properly because we have understood the problem we have ah evaluated various solutions and then have ah taken a decision also by looking at pros and cons of the existing solutions or the ah suggested solutions so it will help us to communicate as well with our bosses or with our family members who are involved in that challenge or who are getting affected by that ah problem. So if at all you are able to communicate well and ah show your solutions then obviously it will also help us in conflict management and it will help us to have better relationships. It will grow our bonds. It will make our bond strong whether it's in the professional life or the personal life because when you are resolving issue, obviously it's a teamwork. One cannot always a single person cannot handle one issue, right? It it involves teamwork. It has to take opinions from various people and sometimes what happens is that we may like two solutions or we may have to combine two ideas and make it as a single solution and evaluate it as a single solution. So, it happens. So, it's a teamwork, right? It's a team effort. Uh when it comes to finding solutions or resolving the problems. I'm sorry I'm using this term towards resolving the problems solving the problems as the topic is about problem solving I force to use that and then it also it will help us to ah have a better relationship because there might be some kinds of arguments while discussing. So if at all you give some feasible solution it will resolve or it will break it will ah diminish or it will those such arguments or differences of opinion can be ah ignored. So in that way it will also help us ah to have ah good conflict management and better ah understanding in any relationship. So it will help us in our professional growth also because when it comes to problem solving ability it works the same. That indude works the same way. You think in the same manner right? Whether it's ah ah something related to your work or office or related to your personal life. So if at all you are good problem solver you will obviously become a natural leader. So you because you communicate well you convince people you go as a team and suggest those suggestions or those solutions to your ah immediate managers or the to your bosses so it will help you in a professional success or professional growth also and all these factors works similarly when it comes to team management or people handling or effective communication it works in a similar format even for the personal life also so it will help you to grow as a human being also because when you face a challenge or when you face the challenges or adversities and when you overcome it through your ah organised thinking and resolve the issues. So it will make you a more confident and more resilient person. So it will help in your personal growth also. It will make you a strong and ah a strong ah strong person and it will even enhance your character. Because you will you will not run away from the or you no more look at the problems as problem rather you look at them as challenges which can be resolved so that it can help us in your growth process in your learning because every problem is a new learning isn't it when you obviously following ah going for the solutions so unknowingly you are learning something new right ah okay so it will also help us in this way it will help us in the continuous improvement ah us ah of ours mean like sometimes what happens is the solution could be upskilling ourselves or changing our mindset towards something or attending some self help session or self help workshop we may not know so it will help us in a continuous improvement or continuous learning so in this way problem solution or problem solving it's not only a skill it's actually a mindset because first of all you should you should have a mindset to look at the inside of the aspect or think about the solutions, right? That itself shows what kind of perspective you have as a human being, right? So, to understand it better, let's get into a story obviously of one actor celebrity by name Jennifer Lauren. Jennifer Lawrence, no doubt she is an American actress and she is well known for this problem solving skills because when it comes to dissension making, she has always maintained a very good balance between the commercial movies also ah which can showcase her versatility as an actress. She worked with the smaller franchises and the larger franchises like X-Men. She in both ways she has shown her versatility and when it comes to story telling also like when it was when the discussions happen to develop a better script to develop the story. Even she was a part of such discussions and she has given many creative ideas which has actually enhanced the plot or the of the plot. In the in a way it can give a blockbuster. So, she has also shown through her problem solving mindset. She has actually shown her creative and innovative way of thinking to the people around. I mean the people who the director or producer or the co actor whoever it may be. So problem solving has actually helped us in good story telling ability also and ah choosing the versatile rules or complex roles at the at the same time commercially successful ah roles shows her adaptability towards the kind of opportunities she is getting. And even ah she has a very she has a very good ah she is very good at mixing with people she don't have this entitled mindset. So she has worked with different varieties of people whether it's a a booming director or a very well known director and also different ah kinds of actors. There might be some popular actors, there might some be upcoming ah art there might be some new artist. She worked with every kind of actor and every kind of technician. It shows how well she managed with her versatile or the adaptable mindset and ah it shows her wonderful decision making ability so that she can ah live in the long term in the industry. And ah ah she has shown her ah what I can say the resilient mindset by maintaining the difference or the distance between the personal and professional life. And she is you can call her an authentic person because like when you are a celebrity obviously obviously there you will be rise of gossips or some kind of controversies, various controversies. Whether you are really have done something wrong or it's a different case but obviously you will be you will get involved into some controversy. She has always been open and sincere in ah addressing those controversies. She never escaped from them or she never avoided questions with regard to those controversies which may spoil her public image. Sheena has never worried about rather she has been authentic and open in addressing them in answering such queries ah with the media and it has helped her to maintain a positive social image as an actress, as a celebrity. So, she in this way she has adopted herself and maintain a well by very balanced mindset in every aspect and which has made her a successful actress in the long term. This shows ah ah this ah she has actually exhibited a wonderful ah mindset or a wonderful example of problem solving mindset. I hope this help and this is tidbitrama signing off.

CimYSPHA3ds|||Five ways to deal with people who hurt you. One, understand the situation in terms of why these people hurt you. It could simply be their own insecurity like jealousy, hatred or simply lack of courage to follow up with their claims and promises. Two, distance yourself from them and avoid them as much as possible. This will not just give you some peace of mind but also avoid further confrontation and it's also true for your family members or close social circle. Three, ask them upfront why they are doing so to you. Be firm yet polite. Four, try getting a second opinion or a fresh perspective about what you are feeling sometimes it's not worth feeling hurt about. And lastly, if you are truly justified about your hurt then feel happy for yourself that you got rid of a person who is not worthy of you, your feelings and your attention and move on.

She replied, yes, I have a big problem with my exams. How will Krishna solve this? I was amused and replied saying that, just like Arjuna did not want to fight the war, but Krishna inspired him. Why he is supposed to fight and perform his duty. Similarly, Krishna will inspire why you must study and score well in your exams. So Gita does not make us lazy or Krishna does not create miracle for us, but inspires us in right direction so that we create miracles. What do you think about this? Write down below. Thank you.

Many friendships will come only to fade as quickly as a firework, but some, a rare and precious few, turn life up to eleven and keep it there. You gotta hold on to friends like these because, just like air, you'll miss them when they're gone. No one else gets it, but they do, cause they know what's in your soul, your heart, your mind. They can blindside you, come out of nowhere, but you'll know them right away, you'll click as perfectly as a jack plug into an amp. They'll know what you're thinking before you've thought it, anticipating your every move. They'll understand the demons, as well as the angels inside of you, never judging you for it either. And together, you'll uncage a thrill that makes you surge with life, but don't be fooled. Friendships are not easy, you gotta put the effort in, and take as good care of them as you do your own flesh, pleasure.

C0MET0Svk5R|||quote I heard from amazing entrepreneur, Alex Ramosi, and he said, one simple question you can ask yourself is, why can't I 10X this business? Or why can't you do three times more sales than you already are doing? Why can't you hire 10 more people? Why can't you start that new industry? And when you ask this really audacious, bold question, the first problems that instinctively appear are the problems that you need to solve to accomplish that. So for example, if you're like, why can't I 10X this business? You go, well, we would need 100 different people to do that. You're like, oh, okay, so you need to hire 100 people. But we would need at least six, seven people to manage all those people. Okay, so now you need to hire that. Well, we'd have to spend 10 times more money. Okay, now I gotta figure out how to get more money. And while those things are gonna be difficult to achieve, you now know that you essentially need to hire 100 people, you need to find eight people that can manage it, and you need 10X the budget to produce that result.

CsqXhLAPwUg|||Hey everyone, happy Thursday. So for today's thought, I wanted to go off of some words of wisdom that Autumn shared during the 21 day fix super block that I just completed. And the one in particular, trust me, she has so much to share, which I love. But the one thing in particular is in regards to where you put your energy. Are you putting your energy into the problem or are you putting your energy into the solution? Because dependent on where you have that energy going is what's going to grow and get bigger and bigger and bigger. So I'm going to just safely guess that you don't want to continue to put energy into the problem. You want to put energy into solution. So what do I mean by that? What I mean is yes, the problem's there, but don't focus so much on it. Really turn your attention to whatever the solution might be for that problem. I'll give an example in regards to happiness. I want to be happy. Okay, well what does that mean to you? If maybe evaluating your day-to-day, identifying things throughout your day or in your life that are bringing you more negative, down-the-dump feelings, then maybe change it. Maybe implement, you know, I'm a huge advocate for movement. Maybe add more movement into your life. Maybe get some activities that you know you'll enjoy to nurture the happiness. So put the energy where you want it to go and into the solution.

Average people say it's their boss' fault, it's their mother's fault. I used to be average, I used to say, when is my daddy coming to get me, when is my biological father going to come in my life, and when I would talk like that I end up getting kicked out of school, and when I talk like that I end up being homeless, and when I talk like that I was broke.

She's a radical feminist who believed men lived on easy mode and tried to prove it by disguising herself as a man for two years. Instead, what she found out is that men actually have it very hard and wrote a book about her experience. The experience was so bad that she had to stop after 18 months because she was starting to hate women due to how bad the women treated her when she believed she was a man. Men are suffering. They have different problems that women have but they don't have it better. They need our sympathy They need our love. They need each other more than anything else. They need to be together. Do you think women understand what it's like to be a man? Not at all. No clue. No idea. I really like being me and I really like being a woman. Did you like being a woman before Ned? I did but I like it more now because I think it's more of a privilege.

C0sYusRqLEg|||Back in the 50s, there was a company that manufactured drinking glasses and shipped them. They packaged them in newspaper to keep them from breaking. But what was happening is the people who worked wrapping the glasses would see an interesting article and they'd start reading it. Their profitability plummeted. They didn't know how to solve this problem. So they got together, the leaders said, what are we going to do about this problem with the productivity? These workers are reading the newspaper articles, they're not doing their jobs. So they had the usual punishments and rewards and looked into like packaging alternatives. And then someone finally said, you know what? We should just poke out their eyeballs. It's a bad idea, messy idea, illegal idea. But that idea is what gave them the idea to look for visually impaired people who could otherwise not find jobs. They hired them to package the glasses. They weren't interested in the articles, but actually they had strong tactile skills. So they packaged the glasses more carefully. They had less breakage. Poking out their eyes is a bad idea, but that's the idea that gave them the idea that changed absolutely everything for their company.

The first version of the switcher was simple and used PVC pipe and a flat board. The problem was stray sawdust built up in the grooves and made it harder to switch, hence switching to a more organic rounded design. People have also mentioned that PVC can build up a static electrical charge and possibly start a fire. I don't know if that's true, but I'm not going to take that chance.

C0gvZW1oeLv|||Và sau khi mình đã nghiên cứu rất nhiều báo cáo, mình tổng hợp được một bức tranh rằng là có 3 nhóm kỹ năng kiến thức mà mỗi người chúng ta cần phải trao dòi trong thời đại bây giờ. Đầu tiên là nhóm Cognitive Skills, đây là những kỹ năng thể hiện việc nhận thức, đánh giá thông tin của mỗi người chúng ta. Cách mà khi chúng ta tiếp nhận một thông tin, chúng ta tiếp nhận một vấn đề để đánh giá, phân tích nó ra sao và từ đó chúng ta giải quyết vấn đề ra như thế nào thì đây là nhóm thứ nhất. Nhóm số 2 là những kỹ năng Self-Efficacy, đây là những kỹ năng, những tố chức mà mỗi người cần có để có thể tự tạo ra sự hiệu quả cho bản thân mình. Ví dụ như là bạn có thể kiên trì bền bỉ vượt khó để có thể tự chủ động tạo ra sự hành công hay không. Và nhóm số 3 đó là nhóm kỹ năng về Technology rất quan trọng trong thời đại bây giờ. Và trong các báo cáo khảo sát về tình hình nhân sự trên thị trường, trong nhóm Cognitive Skills thì 2 kỹ năng quan trọng nhất mà nhà tuyển dụng tìm kiếm ở ứng viên, xếp mong đợi ở nhân viên. Số 1 đó là tư duy phân tích Analytical Thinking và số 2 là tư duy sáng tạo Creative Thinking. Và nếu đây là lần đầu tiên bạn nghe về câm từ Analytical Thinking thì mình cũng sẽ cảm thấy rất bình thường bởi vì theo khảo sát thì ở Việt Nam cái tố chức kỹ năng năng lực này ở người nhân viên đang thấp hơn mức trung bình của toàn thế giới. Ở Việt Nam chỉ đạt 46% trong khi mức trung bình trên thế giới là trên 50%. Vì sao mà người Việt Nam lại thiếu kỹ năng này? Vì đơn giản là trong chương trình học của 12 năm phổ thông cũng như đại học thì rất ít chuyên ngành hay chuyên môn đào tạo chúng ta về kỹ năng Analytical Thinking này. Vậy Analytical Thinking là gì? Thì theo cách hiểu của mình, một người có tư duy phân tích tốt là khi người ta tiếp nhận một vấn đề nào đó cần giải quyết, người ta luôn biết cách để hiểu rõ cái vấn đề đó, chia nhỏ vấn đề đó ra để quan sát từng chi tiết, sau đó sắp xếp lại thành một bức tranh, một sơ đột hoàn chỉnh. Và khi họ phân tích, đánh giá, họ luôn đi sâu, toàn vẹn những bức tranh đó và để họ đưa ra được một quyết định hiệu quả cuối cùng để giải quyết vấn đề đó. Và cái Mindset cũng như là phương pháp mà mình luôn luôn áp dụng để cải thiện được khả năng tư duy phân tích của mình trong kể cả cuộc sống hàng ngày cũng như công việc, đó là khi tiếp nhận một vấn đề, mình luôn đánh giá vấn đề đó một cách toàn vẹn theo sáu cái yếu tố WHO, WHAT, WHY, WHEN, HOW và WHICH. Bởi vì là dù cho là vấn đề đó là vấn đề gì thì nó cũng sẽ xoay quanh sáu cái chữ cái đó thôi. Ai là những người tác động tới vấn đề đó, vấn đề đó tác động đến cái gì, vấn đề đó xảy ra vào thời gian khi nào, tại sao vấn đề đó xảy ra, vấn đề đó xảy ra như thế nào, vấn đề đó xảy ra ở địa điểm nào. Sau đó mình hệ thống hóa lại theo một cái cây logic tree, mình lấy một ví dụ như thế này, khi chúng ta đối diện với một cái bài toạn là xếp hỏi, làm sao chúng ta có thể cải thiện danh thu trong tháng tiếp theo, thì rõ ràng là để phân tích vấn đề đó, chúng ta phải xét 5 yếu tố, 6 yếu tố, WHO, WHAT, WHY, WHEN, HOW ở trên đúng không? Ngoài ra sau khi mình đã đánh giá được vấn đề rồi, mình sẽ hệ thống hóa lại theo một cái sôi đột. Và để tăng được lợi nhuận, chúng ta bị tác động bởi 2 yếu tố, đó là danh thu và chi phí. Làm sao chúng ta có thể tăng danh thu nhiều hơn? Rõ ràng, chúng ta sẽ tìm thêm các thàng mới hoặc là tối u hóa, các thàng cũ. Còn chi phí thì chúng ta phải cắt giảnh chi phí cố định và chi phí linh hoạt. Tương tự như vậy, mọi người vạch ra những yếu tố thành một sôi đột, một hệ thống, để khi mọi người nhìn vào hệ thống đó, mọi người cảm thấy nó thực sự logic đầy đủ, không bị thiếu sót bởi một yếu tố nào, thì khi đó mình mới có thể hệ thống hóa được và mình sẽ xây dựng được một chiến lược phân tích cực kỳ hiệu quả. Và với cái logic tree này thì mình tin chắc là mình sẽ không bỏ sót bất kỳ một yếu tố nào.

C0TL4dguCb1|||This is the classic integral that showed up on the MIT integration beat. I solved it a specific way, but someone commented a different method, so we're going to go ahead and explore that together. I still find it hard to believe that this was on an MIT integration beat, but the first thing that people do is they notice that we can rewrite the bottom into this, because this becomes a perfect square with that minus 1. And now we can go ahead and use u-substitution. Here's our value for dx, and we can go ahead and rewrite the integral. A couple things are going to happen. The x to the 9 are going to go away. Now we can go ahead and bring that 10 that was in the denominator and put it out in the front. And notice that I need to change my parameters. When x was equal to 2, u was going to equal to 2 to the power of 10 minus 24, and when x is equal to infinity, u is also infinity. And now we're ready to find the improper integral, but first we need to go ahead and take care of this infinity by giving it this limit. And don't forget, this is not an arctan integral, but it is a special type of integral that you should know. And now we go ahead and use the first fundamental theorem of calculus. And when we take the limit, this value becomes 1, but natural log of 1 is 0, so this goes away. And now we've got the beautiful solution.
Cxj7p-PO5pD|||you'll probably find the domain for this function all wrong. So in order to find the domain for this function, we're first gonna go ahead and find the discontinuities. We get eight and negative eight. And this is where pre-calc students get confused. We have a square root function and keep in mind that every value inside the square root has to be greater than or equal to zero. We factor it out and we get the values that make this equal to zero is negative seven and four. Here I have my values in the number line and I know they can exist within the function. So I'm gonna go ahead and put a closed circle. And now we're gonna test points. When we test our points, I'm only gonna test points within the square root, because that's the only time where there's some constraints. Now I'm gonna test my points using the factored form. So for negative nine, we have a negative value times a negative value. That's a positive. For negative 7.5, we get a negative value times a negative value. Again, that's also a positive. For zero, we get a positive value times a negative. That's a negative. So we know this cannot be in our domain. For six, we have a positive times a positive and that's gonna be a positive, that fits. And for nine, we have a positive times a positive and that makes it a positive value. So that also fits in our domain. So now at the end, we say that our domain is negative infinity to negative eight, not included, union negative eight to negative seven, bracket, union, bracket four to eight, union eight to infinity.

Let's go ahead and do this together but make sure you save this video. This is a classic. We have F prime and we want to find the original function. And that just means that this is going to be the integral of this particular F prime solving this using the power rule and now we're going to go ahead and clean this up Now we have the original F of X but with this plus C and this is what you need to remember every single time. We are given the particular point so we're going to go ahead and plug that negative one in for the X and our five is going to be the Y. And now we simplify. And we get that the C value for this particular solution is nine And now we have the equation for the original F of X. Don't you ever miss this type of problem in any test.

CsF_dsjvvaj|||Why is teaching shapes important? Teaching basic shapes for kids helps them understand their own observations. Kids take some time before they can actually name the shapes that they see. Kids tend to mix up similar shape letters like B and D. Once a child is comfortable identifying shapes, they can start learning mathematical operations like addition and subtraction. Facial recognition and navigation skills are swiftly developed amongst kids who can categorize and compare various shapes. Brain development thinking skills are really important for a kid in preschool or kindergarten. Kids love to play around the park. This is important for development of their motor skills.

Emerging as a torchbearer, he ignited a mathematical revolution. Within the sanctuary of his observatory, Al-Khwarizmi immersed himself in the enigmas of the cosmos, tracing constellations and unlocking celestial secrets that guided sailors, dreamers, and scholars alike.

C0aiCJhCl4y|||Question number six, twice the number N increased by eleven is the same as six times the number decreased by nine. What's the value of N? Let's assume the number is represented by the variable N here. According to the information given, the equation can be written like this. To N plus 11 is equal to six N minus nine. To solve for N we can start by simplifying the equation so we add nine to this side and also subtract two N from this side so we get eleven plus nine is equal to six N minus two N so twenty gets equal to four N in here we just divide both side of the equation by four and N gets equal to five. This is the answer.

Any qualification that you might be pursuing, be it a C8, an ACC8, a CP8 or any other accounting qualification, you are most likely to come across an ethics board. Ethics is simply allowing an individual to make the right decision between what is right or wrong in every context, giving you a framework or guidance on how to make these decisions. Of course, we understand in ethics, there is no definite right or no definite wrong and hence, studying the same allows you to make the right decisions in challenges that you might come across in your professional journey.

CxWwjpKx9H6|||Is a method that make calculus students also happy. It's called the and I'm going to show you two examples and this too said that if you get some sort of indeterminate form then what you can do is turn our function into a fraction where you take the derivative of the top and of the bottom separately. In this first limit, if we go ahead and use direct substitution, you will see that we get zero over zero and that's an indeterminate form and now we can go ahead and take the derivative of the top and of the bottom separately or we have one over two X plus three and now we go ahead and plug in the negative back into our function and we get one over negative four plus three or negative one. In this limit you'll see that we plug in infinity and we get infinity times sign of one over infinity. One over infinity is zero so we have infinity times zero which is an indeterminate form. And in order for us to use row we need to turn this into a fraction and this is the tricky part. All you have to do is rewrite this into this if you try to use some basic fraction arithmetic you'll see that this is the same value now we can go ahead and take the derivative at the top and at the bottom I get this value using chain roll and there's a derivative at the bottom and you'll notice that these functions cancel out and that leaves us with this limit where we can go ahead and plug in infinity once again one over infinity is zero A cosign of zero is just equal to one.

C0VLrUpxLJc|||Let's talk about solving this particular integral. It's going to involve some substitution and rearrangings to buckle up, because we're about to have some fun. I find this integral really satisfying, and I'm going to start off by making x equal to tan theta. And when we take the derivative, we get that as our dx. Now let's change our parameters. When x is equal to 0, theta is equal to 0. And when x is equal to 1, theta is equal to pi over 4. Now we have this new integral where you notice that 1 plus tan square theta is the same thing as secant square theta, because that's an identity, so these cancel out. Now all we have to do is integrate this value here. And now we're going to go ahead and use something called the King's rule, where this integral is the same thing as this integral, where you have a plus b minus x. So that means that this integral here is equal to the natural log of 1 plus tan of pi over 4 minus theta. And we can use a difference formula for tangent. And now we recognize that tan pi over 4 is equal to 1, which might look like it's getting worse, but we're going to go ahead and get common denominators and we can add the 1 to this. And check this out. The tan thetas cancel out, and 1 plus 1 is equal to 2. We're almost there. We can go ahead and use the properties of logarithms to subtract these. And now let's go ahead and add this to the other side. This is just the constant, so we can integrate this using the first fundamental theorem of calculus. And now we go ahead and divide the 2 to the other side. And now we have our solution. Boom.

CyR8oAFxwYz|||Let's do a review of the Rational Root Theorem. This is something you'll definitely see in pre-calculus, so make sure you save this video. So if we're going to solve this using the Rational Root Theorem, we need to remember that we need to find the factors of the constant and divide that by the factors of the leading coefficient. So the possible factors for our constant, which is negative 3, is going to be plus or minus 1, or plus or minus 3, divided by the possible factors for the leading coefficient, and that's just going to be plus or minus 1. That leaves us with these possible factors. So now we need to test these values using synthetic division, and let's go with 3. I have 3 on the outside, and I have these coefficients inside. We get a remainder of 0, and now we know that this function factors out to this. We can't factor this out, so we're going to go ahead and use the quadratic formula. We get the remaining factors, and now we've found the roots for the function.

Cz99PU2JB-p|||An optimization problem that calculus teachers love to give their students. If you're taking calculus and learning about optimization then you might want to save this video. The question goes like this. You have a rectangle inscribe the semi circle. With the equation Y is equal to root 25 minus X squared. And what they want us to do is maximize the area. Here's the tricky part because we're on a coordinate plane we're going to label this X and this side will also be X. And the height will be our Y. Though the equation for the aerial becomes two X times Y. Cuz we're working with optimization. We're going to use this equation here to plug it in into our value of A so that we can an equation just with X and because we're trying to optimize we're going to take the derivatives instead equal to zero and guess what we're going to use product root here hopefully you can follow along as to how I got that derivatives over here a couple things cancel out not that I set this equal to zero some people call this cheating but you can go ahead and move this to the other side and then multiply the root 25 minus X squared to the other side so that we're left with two X squared is equal to two times 25 minus X squared let's go ahead and create some space here you. Much better and let's go ahead and distribute the two and bring the two X squared to the other side. We divide by four and take the square root. And you'll see that this simplifies to five root 2 over 2. Now we have two values of Xs but the negative cannot be true because we can never have a negative length. So our X value is going to be five root two. So what's the Y value?

Cw-sEklOaSb|||Honestly, watching this video hurt my heart. And I also realized that most people out there are not trained in understanding canine body language and behavior. So let's take a look at this together. We can see whale eye which is where the whites of the eyes are showing and that indicates fear. You can see that his ears are actually back and his weight is also shifted back. And he's thrashing side to side. But I do want to point out that he is not lunging forward. It does look like his person kind of restraining him with her legs. But you can still see the difference in weight shift when they want to lunge forward versus thrashing away from the person which is what this dog was doing. And that means that he's trying to escape. Now once he's dragged forward this guy does the one thing that you don't ever do to a fearful dog. You really don't do it to any dog. Why not? Oh look at that because it stresses them out so they bite. Yeah. Sounds about When a stranger approaches like this, it's perceived as dangerous. Which is exactly how this dog is interpreting it. Everything about this dog's body language says that he is panicked and he's trying to escape. So now this dog has gone into a freeze moment because he doesn't know what else to do. But as soon as he sees an opportunity he starts to try and thrash to get away again. I could give a more technical breakdown here but I don't need to. That is clearly terror in this dog's eyes. So again we've got the thrashing in an attempt to get away. And it's important remember that when we muzzle a dog, we are taking away their primary defense. I'm a big advocate for the use of muzzles but they should be conditioned appropriately and this is not the right use. Now, this dog is leaning back as hard as he can pulling against the leash but also looking over his shoulder at his person. He's looking for help. And now you'll see he actually defecates himself. And as he starts to get pulled forward again, he does start to turn to look probably for an escape route or to see if there is anyone who can help him. I don't know about you guys but if the person that I trusted the most took me to a room, handcuffed me, put a rope around me, and handed that rope to a strange man who started pulling me towards him and poking and prodding me, I would panic. And you know what? I'd probably become aggressive. But much like the dog in this video if it went on long enough and I realized that noone was going to help me and I didn't have an escape route I would probably shut down like this dog does and just comply until I knew that there was a safe alternative. But would I have learned anything in that process? Would I have become less fearful? What do you think? Would you be less fearful after that experience?

CwsrdAGxcz5|||Today's hard truth message comes to you with love and compassion of course and wearing something very weird because I was hot and cold but it's about fear. There's a lot of misinformation out there about food and about exercise for especially women in our age group and that leads to a lot of fear. I'm speaking specifically about things like cortisol. A lot of women out there are afraid to do cardio anymore or to push their heart rate too high to push the effort too high on their exercise because they've heard that it raises cortisol and that you store fat. Well number one we need the cortisol. We actually need the cortisol for a whole bunch of things in your body. Um the key thing is that you learn how to manage the cortisol and that it is not consistently elevated. So instead of being fearful and not doing something because you're afraid of what it might do. Test it out. You don't have to stick with it if it doesn't work with you. So if it doesn't fat make you feel awful and it doesn't fat seem that you are storing fat but that may be other reasons. Um then stop it. Give it a try. Test it out. Don't be afraid of trying something because of what might happen.

I just love them so much. I couldn't let them go. And they were willing to to sacrifice their life, their happiness, their soul eroding their confidence in the process because when you are not true to yourself and you're not making yourself happy and your needs aren't being met you start to hate yourself. You resent yourself and you and you load yourself even more because you can't walk away and now that makes you feel like you're not strong. Eroding your sense of joy in life. Praying, hoping that one day your needs will be met.
CunWZLfLUby|||The reason why a lot of people won't become who they want is because they're too attached to who they've been. And you hear it all the time when people say I've always been this way. Okay well if that's working for you keep doing that. I knew it wasn't working for me any longer. I had hit my version of rock bottom. So I was willing to let go of everything. And everybody. See another reason why people won't get there is because the doorway is for you to fit through. You trying to carry everybody else through because you trying to be rescue nine one one. And you gotta rescue you first. I am much more valuable to my family and to my community because I was willing to let them go. Go through the door. Myself. Teach myself. Learn myself. Condition myself and then come back and get them. I'm much more valuable to them now.

I 1933 skrev denne forfatteren, Aksel Sannemose, denne boka. Den handler om en gutt som bor i en by som heter Jante. Boka handler om hvordan mennesker i samfunnet kan negativt presse hverandre med. I denne fiktive byen Jante er det ti regler som heter Jantelåven. For eksempel, nummer en, du skal ikke tro at du er noe. Det handler om at man skal være ydmyk, ikke skrite av seg selv og ikke tenke at man er best eller flinkere enn andre.

Les dons permettent de financer la recherche pour mieux comprendre ces maladies, trouver de nouveaux traitements, aider les malades en leur assurant l'accès aux soins et aux équipements nécessaires. Et puis informer le public et les professionnels de santé pour des diagnostics plus rapides. Et les avancées sont bluffantes. Depuis 1986, plus de 1000 gènes responsables de maladies rares ont été trouvés avec des traitements innovants comme les thérapies géniques. Et ça a changé la vie de beaucoup de gens. Le Téléthon a aussi mis en place des centres spécialisés pour garantir des soins de qualité. Et grâce aux campagnes d'info, on lève le voile sur ces maladies et on brise l'ignorance et la stigmatisation. Bref, le Téléthon, c'est essentiel dans la lutte contre les maladies rares.

In Sweden, we always watch Kalle Anka 3 p.m. on Christmas Eve. Without Kalle Anka, it can't be Christmas. On Christmas Eve, Norwegians turn on the TV at 5 p.m. to watch Sølgutne sing. Sølgutne is a special choir in Norway consisting of both young boys and men, and they literally sing like angels.

The rules for buying alcohol in Norway are almost the same, however we can buy from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays. We always take our shoes off before we enter our own house or somebody else's house. It's extremely common and we do it automatically before we enter a private house.

So I'm going to show you really quick something that I do in order to find the followers that I should be engaging with. Okay? So first I go to the people that I am following on my homepage. I click on it. Okay. Then I'm going to go up here to sort by default. I click on that. I get it earliest. It. Then I go to least interacted with. This gives me a list of people I should be spending at least 15 minutes a day talking to because I have not been. Okay and so the really cool thing here is now I'm able to open this list and I'm able to open these accounts individually. And I look at when the last time they posted this. Right? If they're inactive why are you following them? Get rid of them. Flear them out. Replace them. Replace them with an account that is active. Or don't replace them. And then give yourself more time to engage with the people you're already engaging with. But don't let them sit there. Okay? But be careful to not do too many at a time. And what I mean is don't go unfollow, unfollow, unfollow, unfollow, unfollow. You will get blocked. You will have a problem.

C0S4uEuMxTe|||So I'm autism and I think my mom knew about it and she kept it from me for years. When I was in pre-kind kindergarten I was evaluated. I was given an IEP. And my mom never discussed the IP with me. She never allowed me to go to like the IEP reviews or talk about like the milestones at school. I I was never allowed to be part of those meetings from pre-K kindergarten all the way to my senior year of high school. Pretty early on I I was taken out of classes for occupational therapy counseling and speech therapy because I had pretty bad speech and language impairment until I was in about eighth grade. So, my mom whenever I'd asked her about why I was doing all the stuff, she's like, it's because of your speech. None of the other kids were taken out for occupational therapy or counseling to work on emotions and to work on social interactions with other kids and and and you know, why I I should or shouldn't talk about certain things. Um none of the other speech kids did that. None of the other speech kids had to go to a separate room to be read their test or or be pulled out to work on reading and eventually I I found out I was dyslexic but it still left a lot of other questions. I quickly felt very alone and very isolated because I had all these questions that that weren't answered and I was always told by by teachers and and by students and by you know, some extended family that how weird and how strange and how odd I was but I completely assimilated. I I I would watch how people would stand and try to stand like them or how they would sit in a chair the way they were sitting in a chair and I would watch their facial reactions or things that they would say or their speech patterns and I would try to to mimic that. I wear clothes that I hated because everyone else was wearing it and when I wore it, I didn't understand like why my friends didn't feel like their skin was like itching and on fire. I tried to do anything that made me not look as different as I felt. Eventually, when I was in college getting ready to go to grad school, I got evaluated. Um a full like mental health screening. Did I no ADHD and it and it answered a lot of questions and it made sense and it and it felt good and when I took medication for it, it helped dramatically and so I was like, yeah, I have ADHD and I do. I do have ADHD. There's still so many signs and and symptoms and things I was feeling that didn't answer with just ADHD. So, then my therapist asked me if they could screen me for autism. I I I was pretty confident that that wasn't the case though very quickly and and sure enough I got the autism diagnosis and it wasn't something I was ashamed of or something that you know I I felt badly about because there's no reason to feel that way I felt like I finally had answers and this very difficult thing happened when I was talking to a teacher I had when I was a kid. I told them about my ADHD and my autism diagnosis and they paused and it was very sad. And they said did you not know that was part of your IDP? So it's something that I didn't know that people had known about me for years because I didn't know about myself. Right? And I very quickly realized that it was something that my mom was keeping from me. My mom's my mom's past. She's she's gone now. And it's a brings up a lot of complex emotions as you can imagine. I understand based on the knowledge and resources that she had. She she was doing what she thought was best. And so I wouldn't feel bad about myself or feel like I was different. I think she's worried that that knowing this would make me feel limited but not knowing it felt so much worse growing up. Parents if you're withholding information like this from your child. Your kids have questions on those bells. I've had so many questions about myself since I was a kid at through adulthood. It doesn't make them feel isolated. It answers questions that they had. When we're tying shame to these things the Shame is what makes children and adults feel like they don't belong. When we give them the gift of knowing the gift of awareness and the gift of understand themselves. That gives them a fighting chance at feeling like they belong.
