      "So I'm autism and I think my mom knew about it and she kept it from me for years. When I was in pre-kind kindergarten I was evaluated. I was given an IEP. And my mom never discussed the IP with me. She never allowed me to go to like the IEP reviews or talk about like the milestones at school. I I was never allowed to be part of those meetings from pre-K kindergarten all the way to my senior year of high school. Pretty early on I I was taken out of classes for occupational therapy counseling and speech therapy because I had pretty bad speech and language impairment until I was in about eighth grade. So, my mom whenever I'd asked her about why I was doing all the stuff, she's like, it's because of your speech. None of the other kids were taken out for occupational therapy or counseling to work on emotions and to work on social interactions with other kids and and and you know, why I I should or shouldn't talk about certain things. Um none of the other speech kids did that. None of the other speech kids had to go to a separate room to be read their test or or be pulled out to work on reading and eventually I I found out I was dyslexic but it still left a lot of other questions. I quickly felt very alone and very isolated because I had all these questions that that weren't answered and I was always told by by teachers and and by students and by you know, some extended family that how weird and how strange and how odd I was but I completely assimilated. I I I would watch how people would stand and try to stand like them or how they would sit in a chair the way they were sitting in a chair and I would watch their facial reactions or things that they would say or their speech patterns and I would try to to mimic that. I wear clothes that I hated because everyone else was wearing it and when I wore it, I didn't understand like why my friends didn't feel like their skin was like itching and on fire. I tried to do anything that made me not look as different as I felt. Eventually, when I was in college getting ready to go to grad school, I got evaluated. Um a full like mental health screening. Did I no ADHD and it and it answered a lot of questions and it made sense and it and it felt good and when I took medication for it, it helped dramatically and so I was like, yeah, I have ADHD and I do. I do have ADHD. There's still so many signs and and symptoms and things I was feeling that didn't answer with just ADHD. So, then my therapist asked me if they could screen me for autism. I I I was pretty confident that that wasn't the case though very quickly and and sure enough I got the autism diagnosis and it wasn't something I was ashamed of or something that you know I I felt badly about because there's no reason to feel that way I felt like I finally had answers and this very difficult thing happened when I was talking to a teacher I had when I was a kid. I told them about my ADHD and my autism diagnosis and they paused and it was very sad. And they said did you not know that was part of your IDP? So it's something that I didn't know that people had known about me for years because I didn't know about myself. Right? And I very quickly realized that it was something that my mom was keeping from me. My mom's my mom's past. She's she's gone now. And it's a brings up a lot of complex emotions as you can imagine. I understand based on the knowledge and resources that she had. She she was doing what she thought was best. And so I wouldn't feel bad about myself or feel like I was different. I think she's worried that that knowing this would make me feel limited but not knowing it felt so much worse growing up. Parents if you're withholding information like this from your child. Your kids have questions on those bells. I've had so many questions about myself since I was a kid at through adulthood. It doesn't make them feel isolated. It answers questions that they had. When we're tying shame to these things the Shame is what makes children and adults feel like they don't belong. When we give them the gift of knowing the gift of awareness and the gift of understand themselves. That gives them a fighting chance at feeling like they belong.\n",

      "Alright guys. So last night I talked to you about followers and how to basically engage with them. Right? And I told you it's a great practice to spend 15 minutes a day on them. So I'm going to show you really quick something that I do in order to find the followers that I should be engaging with. Okay? So first I go to the people that I am following on my homepage. I click on it. Okay. Then I'm going to go up here to sort by default. I click on that. I get it earliest. It. Then I go to least interacted with. This gives me a list of people I should be spending at least 15 minutes a day talking to because I have not been. Okay and so the really cool thing here is now I'm able to open this list and I'm able to open these accounts individually. And I look at when the last time they posted this. Right? If they're inactive why are you following them? Get rid of them. Flear them out. Replace them. Replace them with an account that is active. Or don't replace them. And then give yourself more time to engage with the people you're already engaging with. But don't let them sit there. Okay? But be careful to not do too many at a time. And what I mean is don't go unfollow, unfollow, unfollow, unfollow, unfollow. You will get blocked. You will have a problem.\n",

So in order to replace your sunroof, you have to remove the whole entire panoramic roof. And to get that out, you have to remove your seats to get the headliner off and then you gotta take the headliner out to get to the roof.

      "The reason why a lot of people won't become who they want is because they're too attached to who they've been. And you hear it all the time when people say I've always been this way. Okay well if that's working for you keep doing that. I knew it wasn't working for me any longer. I had hit my version of rock bottom. So I was willing to let go of everything. And everybody. See another reason why people won't get there is because the doorway is for you to fit through. You trying to carry everybody else through because you trying to be rescue nine one one. And you gotta rescue you first. I am much more valuable to my family and to my community because I was willing to let them go. Go through the door. Myself. Teach myself. Learn myself.

      "Today's hard truth message comes to you with love and compassion of course and wearing something very weird because I was hot and cold but it's about fear. There's a lot of misinformation out there about food and about exercise for especially women in our age group and that leads to a lot of fear. I'm speaking specifically about things like cortisol. A lot of women out there are afraid to do cardio anymore or to push their heart rate too high to push the effort too high on their exercise because they've heard that it raises cortisol and that you store fat. Well number one we need the cortisol. We actually need the cortisol for a whole bunch of things in your body. Um the key thing is that you learn how to manage the cortisol and that it is not consistently elevated. So instead of being fearful and not doing something because you're afraid of what it might do. Test it out. You don't have to stick with it if it doesn't work with you. So if it doesn't fat make you feel awful and it doesn't fat seem that you are storing fat but that may be other reasons. Um then stop it. Give it a try. Test it out. Don't be afraid of trying something because of what might happen.\n",
      "Honestly, watching this video hurt my heart. And I also realized that most people out there are not trained in understanding canine body language and behavior. So let's take a look at this together. We can see whale eye which is where the whites of the eyes are showing and that indicates fear. You can see that his ears are actually back and his weight is also shifted back. And he's thrashing side to side. But I do want to point out that he is not lunging forward. It does look like his person kind of restraining him with her legs. But you can still see the difference in weight shift when they want to lunge forward versus thrashing away from the person which is what this dog was doing. And that means that he's trying to escape. Now once he's dragged forward this guy does the one thing that you don't ever do to a fearful dog. You really don't do it to any dog. Why not? Oh look at that because it stresses them out so they bite. Yeah. Sounds about When a stranger approaches like this, it's perceived as dangerous. Which is exactly how this dog is interpreting it. Everything about this dog's body language says that he is panicked and he's trying to escape. So now this dog has gone into a freeze moment because he doesn't know what else to do. But as soon as he sees an opportunity he starts to try and thrash to get away again. I could give a more technical breakdown here but I don't need to. That is clearly terror in this dog's eyes. So again we've got the thrashing in an attempt to get away. And it's important remember that when we muzzle a dog, we are taking away their primary defense. I'm a big advocate for the use of muzzles but they should be conditioned appropriately and this is not the right use. Now, this dog is leaning back as hard as he can pulling against the leash but also looking over his shoulder at his person. He's looking for help. And now you'll see he actually defecates himself. And as he starts to get pulled forward again, he does start to turn to look probably for an escape route or to see if there is anyone who can help him. I don't know about you guys but if the person that I trusted the most took me to a room, handcuffed me, put a rope around me, and handed that rope to a strange man who started pulling me towards him and poking and prodding me, I would panic. And you know what? I'd probably become aggressive. But much like the dog in this video if it went on long enough and I realized that noone was going to help me and I didn't have an escape route I would probably shut down like this dog does and just comply until I knew that there was a safe alternative. But would I have learned anything in that process? Would I have become less fearful? What do you think? Would you be less fearful after that experience?\n",

      "An optimization problem that calculus teachers love to give their students. If you're taking calculus and learning about optimization then you might want to save this video. The question goes like this. You have a rectangle inscribe the semi circle. With the equation Y is equal to root 25 minus X squared. And what they want us to do is maximize the area. Here's the tricky part because we're on a coordinate plane we're going to label this X and this side will also be X. And the height will be our Y. Though the equation for the aerial becomes two X times Y. Cuz we're working with optimization. We're going to use this equation here to plug it in into our value of A so that we can an equation just with X and because we're trying to optimize we're going to take the derivatives instead equal to zero and guess what we're going to use product root here hopefully you can follow along as to how I got that derivatives over here a couple things cancel out not that I set this equal to zero some people call this cheating but you can go ahead and move this to the other side and then multiply the root 25 minus X squared to the other side so that we're left with two X squared is equal to two times 25 minus X squared let's go ahead and create some space here you. Much better and let's go ahead and distribute the two and bring the two X squared to the other side. We divide by four and take the square root. And you'll see that this simplifies to five root 2 over 2. Now we have two values of Xs but the negative cannot be true because we can never have a negative length.

      "An optimization problem that calculus teachers love to give their students. If you're taking calculus and learning about optimization then you might want to save this video. The question goes like this. You have a rectangle inscribe the semi circle. With the equation Y is equal to root 25 minus X squared. And what they want us to do is maximize the area. Here's the tricky part because we're on a coordinate plane we're going to label this X and this side will also be X. And the height will be our Y. Though the equation for the aerial becomes two X times Y. Cuz we're working with optimization. We're going to use this equation here to plug it in into our value of A so that we can an equation just with X and because we're trying to optimize we're going to take the derivatives instead equal to zero and guess what we're going to use product root here hopefully you can follow along as to how I got that derivatives over here a couple things cancel out not that I set this equal to zero some people call this cheating but you can go ahead and move this to the other side and then multiply the root 25 minus X squared to the other side so that we're left with two X squared is equal to two times 25 minus X squared let's go ahead and create some space here you. Much better and let's go ahead and distribute the two and bring the two X squared to the other side. We divide by four and take the square root. And you'll see that this simplifies to five root 2 over 2. Now we have two values of Xs but the negative cannot be true because we can never have a negative length. So our X value is going to be five root two. So what's the Y value?\n",

      "Is a method that make calculus students also happy. It's called the and I'm going to show you two examples and this too said that if you get some sort of indeterminate form then what you can do is turn our function into a fraction where you take the derivative of the top and of the bottom separately. In this first limit, if we go ahead and use direct substitution, you will see that we get zero over zero and that's an indeterminate form and now we can go ahead and take the derivative of the top and of the bottom separately or we have one over two X plus three and now we go ahead and plug in the negative back into our function and we get one over negative four plus three or negative one. In this limit you'll see that we plug in infinity and we get infinity times sign of one over infinity. One over infinity is zero so we have infinity times zero which is an indeterminate form. And in order for us to use row we need to turn this into a fraction and this is the tricky part. All you have to do is rewrite this into this if you try to use some basic fraction arithmetic you'll see that this is the same value now we can go ahead and take the derivative at the top and at the bottom I get this value using chain roll and there's a derivative at the bottom and you'll notice that these functions cancel out and that leaves us with this limit where we can go ahead and plug in infinity once again one over infinity is zero A cosign of zero is just equal to one.\n",

      "Question number six, twice the number N increased by eleven is the same as six times the number decreased by nine. What's the value of N? Let's assume the number is represented by the variable N here. According to the information given, the equation can be written like this. To N plus 11 is equal to six N minus nine. To solve for N we can start by simplifying the equation so we add nine to this side and also subtract two N from this side so we get eleven plus nine is equal to six N minus two N so twenty gets equal to four N in here we just divide both side of the equation by four and N gets equal to five. This is the answer.\n",

Kids tend to mix up similar shape letters like B and D. Once a child is comfortable identifying shapes, they can start learning mathematical operations like addition and subtraction. Facial recognition and navigation skills are swiftly developed amongst kids who can categorize and compare various shapes.

      "This is a basic question that everyone studying calculus should know. You're given F prime and asked to find the original function crossing through a specific point. Let's go ahead and do this together but make sure you save this video. This is a classic. We have F prime and we want to find the original function. And that just means that this is going to be the integral of this particular F prime solving this using the power rule and now we're going to go ahead and clean this up Now we have the original F of X but with this plus C and this is what you need to remember every single time. We are given the particular point so we're going to go ahead and plug that negative one in for the X and our five is going to be the Y. And now we simplify. And we get that the C value for this particular solution is nine And now we have the equation for the original F of X. Don't you ever miss this type of problem in any test.\n",

      "Five ways to deal with people who hurt you. One, understand the situation in terms of why these people hurt you. It could simply be their own insecurity like jealousy, hatred or simply lack of courage to follow up with their claims and promises. Two, distance yourself from them and avoid them as much as possible. This will not just give you some peace of mind but also avoid further confrontation and it's also true for your family members or close social circle. Three, ask them upfront why they are doing so to you. Be firm yet polite. Four, try getting a second opinion or a fresh perspective about what you are feeling sometimes it's not worth feeling hurt about. And lastly, if you are truly justified about your hurt then feel happy for yourself that you got rid of a person who is not worthy of you, your feelings and your attention and move on. Share this with someone who needs to hear this today.\n",
      "Good morning people. Ah says what you see as a problem is actually a ah an opportunity to grow, to explore the solutions to be become better in life. Do you really think so? This is tidbitrama signing in. So as I said when I say problem so obviously I wanted to talk about the human trait of problem solving. Most of the people think problem solving is not a ah a trait or it's not a constructive ability. But yes to some extent they are they are right. It is not a skill it's actually a mindset where it will help us to look at the positive aspects or the solutions of a challenge or the problem we have at hand which has to be resolved. It will help us to evaluate various solutions and it will help us to what extent that every solution is possible and in a way it will also ah enable ah ah it will enable us to apply those solutions apply that solution because you cannot just implement every other idea comes into your mind right you should evaluate whatever suggestions or the ah solutions you have at hand may be in a team let's say if at all there is a issue everybody can suggest a different ah solution because every mind thinks different they so they have their own trait to ways of handling situations or the issues or the challenges. Whether it's in the personal or the professional life. So once even you resolve ah once when you evaluate all the solutions which are suggested or which are available or which ah through which you get some ideas you can implement a feasible solution. In the sense which is easy to implement. Whether it term it is in terms of fullness or whether it it is in terms of finance or whether it is in terms of duration like some solutions may take long term but we may not have that much time to resolve the issue some issues or some problem has to be resolved immediately may be in a months right may be in a week's time even time duration falls in the feasible ah ah what I can say feasible feasibility criteria so ah problem solving it helps in adaptable basically it will help us to look at various ah what are the positive aspects of the situation it won't help us to ah sulk in ah ah just thinking negatively about the problem or worry worrying about the problem it will help us to analyzing situation or adapt ourselves to the existing circumstances and then in a way when once we evaluate the feasibility and once we start implementing it will help us in making a good decision making, right? Whichever solution is feasible or whichever solution is more adaptable or implementable. It will also help us in decision making. Let's say for all the implemented solution is not giving a expected results or the result is very low. The positive result is very low. Then you can evaluate other solutions which are which are already analyzed or which are already or discuss whatever it the case may be. It will even help us to think innovatively while looking at the issue because once when you have a challenge you have to when you say solution obviously sometimes the existing solutions may not or the regular practice solutions may not work out or they might not be feasible. So obviously you have to think ah to resolve the issue in a creative way in a in in a noble way. So that it will help us to innovate or to check where what are the various ways that the ah challenge can be resolved and it will help us to be creative. And obviously in one of the videos where I we talked or we discussed about creativity. To create it doesn't simply mean artistic side of the human being. It actually relates to everything. Even if you talk about realistic or logical issues. Even creativity plays a vital role in that. Once you are thinking in a noble way or doing something in a noble way that itself is also a creativity that's also 11 act of creativity or one form of creativity so once we have this innovative and creative process to ah ah resolve the problem at hand we will be able to communicate properly because we have understood the problem we have ah evaluated various solutions and then have ah taken a decision also by looking at pros and cons of the existing solutions or the ah suggested solutions so it will help us to communicate as well with our bosses or with our family members who are involved in that challenge or who are getting affected by that ah problem. So if at all you are able to communicate well and ah show your solutions then obviously it will also help us in conflict management and it will help us to have better relationships. It will grow our bonds. It will make our bond strong whether it's in the professional life or the personal life because when you are resolving issue, obviously it's a teamwork. One cannot always a single person cannot handle one issue, right? It it involves teamwork. It has to take opinions from various people and sometimes what happens is that we may like two solutions or we may have to combine two ideas and make it as a single solution and evaluate it as a single solution. So, it happens. So, it's a teamwork, right? It's a team effort. Uh when it comes to finding solutions or resolving the problems. I'm sorry I'm using this term towards resolving the problems solving the problems as the topic is about problem solving I force to use that and then it also it will help us to ah have a better relationship because there might be some kinds of arguments while discussing. So if at all you give some feasible solution it will resolve or it will break it will ah diminish or it will those such arguments or differences of opinion can be ah ignored. So in that way it will also help us ah to have ah good conflict management and better ah understanding in any relationship. So it will help us in our professional growth also because when it comes to problem solving ability it works the same. That indude works the same way. You think in the same manner right? Whether it's ah ah something related to your work or office or related to your personal life. So if at all you are good problem solver you will obviously become a natural leader. So you because you communicate well you convince people you go as a team and suggest those suggestions or those solutions to your ah immediate managers or the to your bosses so it will help you in a professional success or professional growth also and all these factors works similarly when it comes to team management or people handling or effective communication it works in a similar format even for the personal life also so it will help you to grow as a human being also because when you face a challenge or when you face the challenges or adversities and when you overcome it through your ah organised thinking and resolve the issues. So it will make you a more confident and more resilient person. So it will help in your personal growth also. It will make you a strong and ah a strong ah strong person and it will even enhance your character. Because you will you will not run away from the or you no more look at the problems as problem rather you look at them as challenges which can be resolved so that it can help us in your growth process in your learning because every problem is a new learning isn't it when you obviously following ah going for the solutions so unknowingly you are learning something new right ah okay so it will also help us in this way it will help us in the continuous improvement ah us ah of ours mean like sometimes what happens is the solution could be upskilling ourselves or changing our mindset towards something or attending some self help session or self help workshop we may not know so it will help us in a continuous improvement or continuous learning so in this way problem solution or problem solving it's not only a skill it's actually a mindset because first of all you should you should have a mindset to look at the inside of the aspect or think about the solutions, right? That itself shows what kind of perspective you have as a human being, right? So, to understand it better, let's get into a story obviously of one actor celebrity by name Jennifer Lauren. Jennifer Lawrence, no doubt she is an American actress and she is well known for this problem solving skills because when it comes to dissension making, she has always maintained a very good balance between the commercial movies also ah which can showcase her versatility as an actress. She worked with the smaller franchises and the larger franchises like X-Men. She in both ways she has shown her versatility and when it comes to story telling also like when it was when the discussions happen to develop a better script to develop the story. Even she was a part of such discussions and she has given many creative ideas which has actually enhanced the plot or the of the plot. In the in a way it can give a blockbuster. So, she has also shown through her problem solving mindset. She has actually shown her creative and innovative way of thinking to the people around. I mean the people who the director or producer or the co actor whoever it may be. So problem solving has actually helped us in good story telling ability also and ah choosing the versatile rules or complex roles at the at the same time commercially successful ah roles shows her adaptability towards the kind of opportunities she is getting. And even ah she has a very she has a very good ah she is very good at mixing with people she don't have this entitled mindset. So she has worked with different varieties of people whether it's a a booming director or a very well known director and also different ah kinds of actors. There might be some popular actors, there might some be upcoming ah art there might be some new artist. She worked with every kind of actor and every kind of technician. It shows how well she managed with her versatile or the adaptable mindset and ah it shows her wonderful decision making ability so that she can ah live in the long term in the industry. And ah ah she has shown her ah what I can say the resilient mindset by maintaining the difference or the distance between the personal and professional life. And she is you can call her an authentic person because like when you are a celebrity obviously obviously there you will be rise of gossips or some kind of controversies, various controversies. Whether you are really have done something wrong or it's a different case but obviously you will be you will get involved into some controversy. She has always been open and sincere in ah addressing those controversies. She never escaped from them or she never avoided questions with regard to those controversies which may spoil her public image. Sheena has never worried about rather she has been authentic and open in addressing them in answering such queries ah with the media and it has helped her to maintain a positive social image as an actress, as a celebrity. So, she in this way she has adopted herself and maintain a well by very balanced mindset in every aspect and which has made her a successful actress in the long term. This shows ah ah this ah she has actually exhibited a wonderful ah mindset or a wonderful example of problem solving mindset. I hope this help and this is tidbitrama signing off.

Besides the amount of background checks and all kinds of things like that, these guys are constantly getting followed by foreign government's secret agents and by our government secret agents. They have to undergo a whole bunch of training to see if people are following them and do counter surveillance and all kinds of spy stuff but then they also have to be cooking all day. On top of that, the responsibilities that these guys have to deal with, that they need to make sure that nothing happens the president's food and they have to do that across kitchens across the globe. These guys travel with the president to make sure that the food that's being prepared is being prepared properly and then often times, the chef of whatever random country goes, this one is was the president of the United States and they go, no. You don't get to determine that and then they pick one at random because that reduces the chances that anything could happen to the president's food. Also, these dudes have to go to different grocery stores across the Seaboard all the time. They can never go to the same grocery store twice because they need to make sure that they're getting ingredients that aren't being tampered with. If you got it directly from the source potentially a foreign adversary would be able to get at it. Whereas if you just go to a random Albertsons somewhere in Pennsylvania the chances that Russia could have touched it or any other country is basically none.\n",
      "Us government has 1. 6 billion pounds of cheese in caves in Springfield, Missouri. But that's not all. They also have 355 million pounds of butter. Two two hundred eleven million pounds of pecans and nearly a billion pounds of French fries. You can go and see all of the amounts that they have across the all the cold storage amounts of every product. For instance half a billion pounds of beef. These caves are massive. Here's a semi truck for reference. These giant cheese caves in Missouri have been storing these products and continue to do so. What's really funny is it's right next to the Craft Food Distribution Center. I'm not sure how much goes back and forth but I think it's a decent amount. If you guys remember the Area 51 Naruto run into Area fifty-1 to release the aliens, let's do the same thing but with cheese. So I'll go to Springfield, Missouri, dress up like rats and eat some of that cheese. Yum yum yum. This is a joke. If you had one point four billion pounds of cheese, what would you eat?\n",
      "Berlin there's these giant flag towers that look a lot like castles. Why? Well in World War two the Germans trying to defend Berlin built these giant flag towers to defend against the bombing runs. Why are they still around? Because they're made with an extremely large amount of concrete to be able to survive bombing runs. The allies tried to destroy a bunch of them and a lot of times it didn't work because they're super thick. So a lot of them just ended up being in parks or they got buried. Around Berlin there's a whole bunch of these hills. But almost all of them are man made using the rubble from Berlin as well as burying a lot of these flack towers and other defensive structures that they just couldn't destroy because it was such thick concrete. These things are super cool. However, now they're getting to be kind of dangerous because they're now coming up on 100 years old and they're really starting to fall apart now but not falling apart enough for them to be able to be destroyed but now that Berlin's been repaired so much, they can't just blow these things up in place. So, it kind of comes down like are you supposed to do with all these big giant bunkers? Ones like this kind of got buried but not all of them.\n",

      "Portrait is possibly one of the best PR moves in history. It's a portrait of a woman named Charlotte Corday. And Charlotte Corde was arrested and eventually executed for a unaliving a man named Mora who wrote a paper called The Friend of the People that inflamed extremist revolutionary sentiment during the French Revolution. I'm Dana Schwartz. I have a podcast called Noble Blood. So if you want to know like everything about Charlotte Corday just go listen to that episode right now. But the TikTok version we can get to that Now, even though Charlotte Corday unalived a revolutionary leader, she wasn't actually a royalist. She wasn't pro-monarchy. She was also in favor of the French revolution. She was just a member of a more moderate revolutionary faction as opposed to the more extremist Jacobin who led what's now known as the reign of terror. But Charlotte was smart enough to know that if she succeeded in her mission, she would be arrested and probably executed and that the revolutionary propaganda machine would go into full and it did. The man she unalived, Murah, was portrayed as a martyr like in famous paintings like this by David. And the stories about Charlotte Corde came out almost immediately. Revolutionaries were talking about how she was a royalist, she was pro monarchy and how while she was waiting to see Murah, she went to get her hair powdered. Clearly, she's not a champion of the people if she's getting her hair powdered. The Jacoby knew that as a young, beautiful woman, Charlotte Corde would naturally arous\n",
      "What's this map? This map right here. It is the protected area database for the US government. Basically, this is all the government land. It's broken down in the fun sections. For instance, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Department of Defense National Park Service. You can go through and you can look at this. You can zoom in super close on York County on New York City and you can see exactly what's owned by the government. As you can see the East Coast as well as the Midwest and the South. Basically, the government doesn't own any of it. Meanwhile, out west, the government basically owns all of it. There's a lot of benefits and a lot of negatives to the government owning this much land. For instance, cities and states not being able to get enough tax dollars because the federal government is not really paying them enough for that land. However, good benefits. For instance, Noah owns all of this over here on the coast, meaning that they can detect when hurricanes are going to happen. You can also see how much Alaska and Hawaii is owned by the federal government and it's really interesting to see. Are you East Coast or West Coast? Let me know.\n",
      "The way Bob, don't you think it's about time for you to move into your new color set? Well, I have one more question that maybe you can answer while I'm on my way down the studio to the new set. Just what will this change mean to the channel two viewers who will still be watching this in black and white. Well, we think you'll see a big difference on black and white receivers. The new color cameras will give an improved monochrome picture and all our new color sets here in the studio were designed with that in mind. Take it away in full spectrum color. Well, Doug for I'd like to say this that I feel doubly honored to have been chosen to be the first one involved in our big change because there are so many much more colorful characters around here than this reporter. In the news tonight, Governor Hughes has raised doubts about Dubuque's financial flood dilemma. We'll have the story right after this message for Standard Oil.\n",

      "So you have stretchmarks. How awful for you. Oh no that's wrong. It's ugly horrible. How ashamed you must be really. Because stretchmarks are naturally one of the most nasty things you can have. So please don't show them. We would hate that for you for our precious eyes as society. Please pack them away. Be ashamed. Other people don't have them. It's only you love. Only you. Have you ever heard similar words to that even though I may have added a bit to them? Perhaps you read them in magazines when you were a teen, a child, or even an adult. Perhaps you remember, like I do, that in the 2thousands, stretchmarks were only truly mentioned in culture if it was because someone claimed to have finally found the true cure. It was an oil, a scrub, a little machine with electric pulses to soften your skin. And none of them worked other than taking away your money from your account and putting it into theirs. Today we're talking about stretchmarks and why it is that we have been feeling ashamed of them for so very long. Welcome to feminist Friday with me Camilla. I have an academic background in religion, intellectual history, Hebrew and feminist studies and I do this series called feminist Fridays to shed more light on the parts of history we normally don't hear very much about. If you like this and what I do, please leave this video a like and please go support my work on coffee so I can continue doing it. There's a link to the coffee where you can become a member of my hexacamic oven where you normally find those links. It's only three euros a month and it truly would make a difference for me so thanks for doing it. In this video I will be talking about stretchmarks and I will in regards to this talk about pregnancy. Please keep in mind that pregnancy is a thing that happens to those who have a uterus and that having a uterus does not mean you view yourself as a so called woman. If I say something about a pregnant woman in this video refer to what I am saying now. There are more than two genders there always have been so keep that in mind. And with that being said I think we should get right back to the topic of today stretchmarks or as some people like to call them let's talk about angel scratches. Angel scratches or stretchmarks is what happens when your skin is being stretched. They are a form of scars that occur when your body tears during rapid growth. They can typically be when you hit puberty or you fall pregnant or when you gain weight. I personally have stretchmarks from when I hit puberty on my breasts since I went from being a no-breasted individual to having a C cup within such a short time frame that the skin, it simply could not keep up and those stretchmarks in particular have always, always fill me with so much shame that I'm even ashamed of mentioning them right now which is exactly why I'm forcing myself to mention them because why on earth am I ashamed it's my skin it has lines you can see them so what the shame around stretchmarks is not a new phenomenon and I am even though this thought makes me sad I'm sure you know the shame too on some level because it is one we have been fed for long. Let's go back to ancient Egypt for example and see how they thought of stretchmarks. Of course I cannot ask anyone from the time so instead I have found sources saying that we have archaeological finds of little jars shaped like nude women that would have held ointment for the women who were pregnant. This ointment was for their growing bellies because those typically get stretchmarks during pregnant see. Actually, 90% of all pregnant bellies get stretchmarks in the process which then makes it even more ridiculous to see that there are more than 15 million hits on Google when you type in how to get rid of stretchmarks because one can deduce that people want to get rid of them because they do not like them. So, we do not like a very natural thing about ourselves. Why? Some think that a reason for this can be found in history because they think that skin conditions could be used as health indicators. Think of skin turning white when you are sick or for example if you get a rash. You can without being a doctor see that this person is one you shall keep a distance from until they are better in order for yourself not to be infected with whatever they may have. Well that can be a reason. But another one could maybe be found somewhere else. In capitalism. Let's take a look at how many companies that claim to have formulas that can cure your stretchmarks. Just like an ancient Egypt, ointments are still a thing being catered to your mind as the one thing that can solve your insecurities. And if we think of this capitalist aspect as being part of the reason, well, then that leads us down an interesting lane. Imagine, you have a business with a product you like people to buy. Your product in this allegory is tomatoes. You sell them but people don't really buy them. They like them fine enough but your profit is way too low. Okay, so what do you do? Well, you try to make good ads, you make great discounts, bulk options and more but nothing really helps. Then one day, you see your neighbor's business. They also sell tomatoes and their business is thriving. What do they do? Well, they say that their tomatoes cure bad breaths. People hate smelling so they get the tomatoes to get rid of a problem that they relate to. Now remove the tomatoes, remove the bad breath, insert instead oil, lotion and your stretchmarks. If we are being told again and again by companies that their product can solve this issue well then at some point we consider that they're a thing an issue. Of course the method is not as simple as this but it does show that the shame we feel about something that happens to 90% of those of all pregnant to 70% of adolescent girls and 40% of adolescent boys. This is a statistic I have from us also. Please remember what I said about gender but it shows that it's not necessarily a natural shame. It has been placed within our minds. Now can that be said about all things we feel ashamed about? Yes. So why am I saying it? To remind you and myself that our skin is lovely just as it is. It protects us and keeps us safe. Sometimes it has us, sometimes not, and that is totally okay and wonderful. And with that said, I'm now going to, for the first time in my life, wear something that shows off my angel scratches on my breasts because one needs to walk the walk to talk the talk, right? If you like this feminist bride aid, remember to like the video, follow me and also please go to my coffee and become a member so you can help me out with a tiny amount every month. I would much appreciate it. Thank you for watching. May you too want to show off your stretchmarks and love yourself in the process. I know I will do the same. See you next week. Stay feminist.\n",
      "You would be forgiven for thinking that this was a rather glamorous velvet dressing gown but you would be wrong. It's actually a circoat dating from the very early half of the 19th century and it's a coronation circoat because it's red velvet and so it would have been worn under coronation robes. So inside, it's got the maker's label, William Webb, robe maker to his majesty and this means it was either worn at the coronation of George the fourth in 1821 or the coronation of William the fourth 10 years later. But the length gives it away a little bit and enables us to sort of narrow our deductions. Over time, the fashions change and actually circulates became a lot shorter and in the collection, we have another circoat exactly the same more or less although it's slightly shorter. It sort of measures just to stand here. And so from this, we can deduce that the shorter one was worn to William the fourth's coronation and the longer one was worn to George the fourth's earlier coronation. And if that's the case, then it was worn by the fifteen Frenchman but I always think that wearing this underneath is Coronation Roots must have got a little bit toasty.\n",

      "Did you know that DC has a baptismal font that's over a thousand years old? I'm Joe Himalayan today I'm at the bishopsgarden at the national cathedral. The garden was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Junior who apprentice under his world famous father. Construction started in 1925 and completed in 19 28. Many gifts were given to the garden including boxwoods from George Washington's Hayfield Manor. Here's the baptismal font. It's from the 9th century and is surrounded by and flowers that would have been used during that period. The cathedral is located in Cleveland Park which was so named because President Grover Cleveland had a summer house here called Oakview. The timber and stone used for this gazebo or shadow house as it's called was salvaged from Oakview when it was demolished in nineteen twenty-seven. All of the garden's flora is historically, religiously, or locally significant. Throughout the garden, you'll see many stone carvings. Most of which are from the 14th and fifteenth trees.\n",
