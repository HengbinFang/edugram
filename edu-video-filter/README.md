# EduGram Feed

There was quite the steps in order to get the feed.

1. Was to scrape video id's from random gnerated hashtags 
2. Was to transcribe the videos that didn't had any transcriptions for better accuracy
3. Was to process only the english videos as the AI was only trained there
4. Was to finally classify the description and transcription with the AI. To get an output
5. Now you get the educational_videos.txt 

The only thing missing now is combining it with Instagrams algorithm.
