7236839139134410030~1~Remember this is only my thoughts for MY wedding, no judgement on anyone who has done or is doing it more traditionally 🫶🏻❤️ #bridesmaids #bridesmaid #weddingtiktok ~Here is how I'm dealing with the whole bridesmaids thing at my wedding and how I'm doing it differently. And I'm really excited about this. So first and foremost, they are not called bridesmaids because you are not my maid. You're my friend and I'm inviting you to this wedding and I don't expect anything of you other than to show up with a good attitude. You're my bridemaid. You're my friend. Number two, I am having a, I don't even want to call it bachelorette, I'm having my friends, my bridesmaids come a couple days early before the wedding because it's in Florida, a little vacation. You could call it a bachelorette trip if you want, but it's like nothing official and I'm doing it all at once so that they don't have to worry about taking off work twice and they also don't have to worry about paying for two separate trips. I am letting them pick their dress basically completely. I've got like a very big color palette and they can pick the style, they can pick everything. I want them to feel comfortable and confident and we all have different body types and styles and comfort levels and it's important to me that they feel best on the day as well because if they feel their best, I know I'll feel my best. Next, I'm not having them stand next to me like while we're doing our ceremony. Yeah, they'll just be sitting probably in one of the first few rows and they'll be able to enjoy our ceremony instead of having to like be a robot. I will not be whisking them away for two hours after the ceremony to take pictures. We're gonna do pictures in the morning. I'm gonna get ready first thing in the morning. We're gonna do like bridesmaids pictures and then we'll do our first look and then we'll do the other pictures and then we'll do the ceremony. So that way, after the ceremony, we can enjoy the evening and being married and start having fun and all that stuff instead of having to worry about going off and taking pictures and leaving our guests hanging. The wedding is a year and a half away so I still have a lot to plan. I could add more things. There could be more of these coming but as of now, that's all I've got. Let me know if you have any suggestions of things that you also found worked really well to make it super chill, super fun, and not your typical bridesmaid, political, not fun climate.
7239435609302125870~0~Replying to @Funny clips 🤣 ~Y'all really think you could buy a scrub daddy from Walmart all right bet we're going to Walmart then all right, baby You ready to go? Your Balenciaga street grippers All right, baby once again hop up in the Benz Y'all got us doing this every day, man.

We got to get it Let's get two of them all right. We're gonna compare these So as you can see we have the scrub daddies right here and off of first appearance this scrub Daddy look knockoff as hell, bro I don't know what Walmart's been doing lately, but this one just looks more unique and more beautiful It makes me just want to kiss it, but anyways I'm gonna pull it out of the box and so you guys know it's real, bro brand new And we're gonna compare the differences.

7224559608373841178~1~This is the best party trick ~Shows there's no hole in your cup. But when you drop it like this, you do this, and there we go, you separate the liquid from the ice. I'm going to show you how to do the best party to it. So all you need is two cups. So first of all, what you do is you pierce a hole on the bottom of one cup so that come in here. So as you can see now, I pierce a hole in there. You can see that. Right? And you cut out the bottom of this. Not too much are okay. What we have is this. Okay. So you can see the hole in a cup. Yeah. So that's the first step. Okay? We'll leave that there. The second step is you take another cup And make sure they have rigid lines on it like this because it is going to hide something. So when you get plastic cuts, make sure there's two lines in there and k? You then take it and what you do is you just cut just here just on the top of the line. Okay? If you wanna cut just on the top of that line, these are a bit blunt to make sure you got sharp scissors or use a razor blade. But if you're a child, then please make sure you have an adult with you. Okay? So what Now what you do is Family friendly show. Happy. Let's try show. You don't wanna beat you don't wanna cut your fingers. And then what you do is, as you can see, you cut around this just like this make sure you cut on the line because you want this to be hidden, okay, to be cut just above the line. Obviously, I'm doing this far, so this isn't gonna be perfect. I'm just doing this to show you how this works. So there we go. Get rid of that. You don't need that. This is it. This is your gimmick. A wholly one cup and then you cut the bottom section off of another cup. You then place this on there like that and there we go This right here is your gimmick. So now what you do is you fill it up with ice and then you fill it up with liquid and I'm gonna show you what you do next. Put up a cup with the ice just like this. So this obviously hides the hole. Now don't worry about this line here. Obviously, I've cut this wrong, but that's what I said you need to cut it above it, so it blends in with this line here. Okay? So now what you do is once the ice is in, you're gonna take your liquid whatever liquid you want, you then fill it up just like this. And now this is gonna blow your mind. Like I said, this is the best party trick. Especially now a football's coming on, they're gonna be using plastic cups. So do this in a bar. You're gonna win yourself free drinks, all night. Like I did. So watch this. Right? So there we go. That's probably enough. Now right now, it looks horrendous. Because you can see, like, the the the different color I can't do. Right? So you can see the Gimme. So it looks rubbish. So here's what you have to do. You have to get the liquid out here on the outside of this. So all you do is you lift up just to see what I'm doing here. Juts, like this, just like that. There we go. So now as you can see, it all blends in. Yeah? Or can you sort of still still see that? So obviously, you need to make sure it's perfect. So there we go. Just like that. So now Obviously because it's a bit cold, you can sort of see it. If you're holding it like this, you can't see anything, can you? Can you see anything? No. I can't So then while it's dripping everywhere, I'm gonna show you how to do it. Right? So then once you're set up, now you're set, you can hold it like that. You can't see anything. So here's secretly say to them, I'm gonna separate the ice from this drink without putting my hand in. And how you do it? Is this watch? There. There. Now that's the selling point because it shows there's no hole in your cup. But when you drop it like this, you do this and there we go, you separate a liquid from the ice and that's how you win yourself a free drink.
7240472947821907243~0~#KeanuReeves almost changed his name to “Chuck Spadina”. #FallonFlashback ~I love saying your name. I got to say that. It is a exciting for me to say your name. It's a movie star name, and you probably, growing up, you probably didn't think it was a movie star name. No. No, but it is. Keanu Reeves. Do you ever think of... Keanu Reeves. Yeah. But I heard that you maybe thought for a little second of maybe changing your name or your agent's or somebody brought up... Beginning story. Yeah. Okay, so I'm 20 years old, and I'm going to drive in my first car. Yes. And I'm going to drive to Hollywood. And I get there, and my manager, my agent, say, welcome. Yes. This is a great story. Great to see you. And I'm all excited, and they say, great to see you, but we want to change your name. This is the truth. This is Hollywood. This is fantastic. Oh, yeah, no. I mean, they did it the first day I got there. So... I mean, literally, I'm like, hey, man, all right, like, change your name. So, anyway, so I... They don't think Keanu Reeves is hireable. I'm not going to talk about that. So, anyway, so... So, they say, okay, well, help us out. So, I go to the ocean, because this is a big deal for me, right? It's my name. It's my name. And I literally go to the ocean, and you scream, it's my name. It's my name! And so I put it into a seashell, and then you toss the shell into the thing, and it comes back with a name, and what does the shell tell you your name is? There you go. There you go. And I'm like, Chuck Spadina. And then I tell them that, and they're like, no. And I'm like, what's wrong with Chuck Spadina? Isn't that kind of a direction you want? Dude, your name is almost Chuck Spadina. It's my favorite thing. No, but then they didn't like that, so then I went... So you went back to the ocean. Yeah, no, I... You went to a cliff. No, I was getting better at it now. I'm like, okay, so... You summon you at the top of the... They don't want that wave. The rooftops. So I was like, how about Templeton Paige Taylor? I figured... I was like kind of going, you know, that way and then that way. It's perfect because the only thing they could say is, let's just stick with Keanu Reeves. Chuck Spadina. I tried to wear them down. Chuck Spadina is my favorite thing I've ever heard of in my entire life. I wish that for one movie... You kind of have a Chuck Spadina look.

7238715361636404506~1~It would change everything. What’s your opinion on this crazy theory ? 🤯  #truthseeker #truth #mystery #earthmysteries #antarctica #antarcticasecrets  ~We all know that Antarctica is the most mysterious and intriguing continent that exists. Recently, an incredible theory has been spreading and could completely change our perception of this territory. According to this theory, Antarctica is not a vast expanse of ice at the bottom of the earth, but rather a gigantic wall of ice surrounding all the continents of this world. Some even believe that if we were able to cross this ice wall, we would discover other continents that have intentionally been kept hidden from us. In 1992, a new standard world map called the Gleason Map was published, depicting Antarctica encircling all our continents. A very intriguing fact is that the logo of the United Nations strongly resembles this map. A pilot took the risk of going there despite the prohibitions and released a low-quality video claiming to have reached this ice wall, but we cannot be sure if it is truly Antarctica or if it is staged. Scientists have long established that Antarctica is indeed a continent, thanks to satellite images that show its structure and expanse. Therefore, it is important to rely on solid evidence and serious research to understand our world. So, is this theory simply the product of the imagination of some individuals, or are all our beliefs biased?

Check this out. Wild and crazy Friday night findings. We just discovered, which we already knew, that your phone, an iPhone specifically, takes an infrared picture of you with your face ID every five-ish seconds. And we looked at it through an infrared camera and it's pretty wild. Let's show you. Okay, have your home screen? It's on the home screen. Not touching anything. No buttons. Okay, infrared lens on the camera. Boom, there's one. Two. That's so wild. Okay, cover the camera. Oh, there's another one. Okay. Nothing. Oh, it's trying. It's taking pictures of your finger. Okay, move your finger. Ready? Boom. This is something that we can't see with the naked eye. However, with an infrared camera, we can. So a lot of people started testing it out. It's picking me up right now. It became a viral sensation and there are thousands and countless videos of people trying to stay out with their infrared cameras. And well, news stations started trying to explain this. Apple released an official note and apparently what they're saying is that this is an aspect of the iPhone. It has to do with face ID and an emoji. However, internet users were baffled and confused and so am I. Because if this does have to do with face ID, why does it take these invisible pictures every five seconds and not all the time? How does this thing work? It doesn't make sense, does it? Hmm.

7240505265605627182~1~THIS TRANSFORMED MY HAIR, LIKE WOW! Check it out exclusively in stores at @Ulta Beauty or ulta.com and dphue.com! #AD #dpHUE @dpHUE ~I've been putting my hair through a lot and it needs a little love. I mean, even Lulu's hair is shinier than mine. I'm gonna try this DP Hue Glossy Glaze. It is a two-minute at-home conditioning glaze. As a hair amateur, this seems very easy to use at home. Let's hop in the shower and see what we can do. Just so you know, this is my hair before the treatment and it is lacking in every department. I mean, it was dull, rough, it lacked smoothness and shine. So to do the treatment, first you shampoo your hair, get it nice and clean. After the shampoo, I went right in with the glaze. I just applied it to different sections of the hair and then I massaged it in with my hands from root to tip. Extremely easy process and it says it lasts up to three washes. Guys, when I tell you my jaw is still on the floor from these results, I could not believe... This difference is drastic, bro. My hair looks and feels so beautiful. Definitely check it out at Ulta.com or DPU.com. It's worth it.

7235933168820292890~0~This little boy has a little snake😱😱#tiktok #movie #film ~A large snake suddenly appeared in front of the man. The man was so scared that he closed his eyes tightly and didn't dare to breathe. But to his surprise, the snake just gave him a kiss on the forehead. Then it slowly retreated again. The man took a closer look and realized. It was the same little snake he had saved years ago. Ten years ago, the man found a snake egg in a cave. He took it home and incubated it carefully. Soon the baby snake emerged from its shell. It was then that the boy realized. He had rescued a very rare golden and silver python. He saw that it had such a beautiful pattern on its body. The boy couldn't get enough of him. He named him Lisa. But it didn't last long. Daniel's father soon found out about the snake. The father was very much against the idea. He was about to snatch the snake and kill him. But Daniel was quick to run. He escaped from the house just in time. To protect his beloved snake, Daniel went to the river. He was about to release him back into the wild. But the snake loves Daniel. He wouldn't leave. The boy was ready to let him go anyway. Just then. There were shouts from the villagers behind him. They were all looking for Daniel. But just then. A strange scene occurred. Small snakes were suddenly crawling out of the water. They were slowly approaching the crowd. In order to keep Daniel and the villagers out of harm's way. She turned around and went back into the water. With Lisa gone. All the snakes on the ground returned. Ten years had passed. Daniel had grown up to be a big boy. And became a biologist. To work on an anti-cancer drug. He returned to the cannibal island with his team. One expert said. The island is full of exotic treasures. Any one of them is worth a lot of money. And the most precious of all is a plant called golden seal. If we can extract its genes. The secret of immortality will be found.

We need a change of goverment.#conservative #canada #noliberals #freedom #notrudeau #makecanadagreatagain ~But let me tell you something, Justin. There is pain in the faces you do not see. There is suffering in the voices you do not hear, and there is distress and even chaos in the places you do not go. If you don't believe me, come with me over to the local grocery store in East End Ottawa where I was last night, where a sixty year old plus cook came up to me with tears in his eyes to tell me he has to delay his retirement. But you know the thing that really broke him, that he can no longer afford the very ingredients to cook at home, that he works with in his job at work. Justin, if you don't believe me, come to Northern Ontario and ask the elderly woman who lives in the cold because your carbon taxes made it too expensive for her to heat her home. If you don't believe me, Justin, come speak to the students who live in homeless shelters while they go to school, Because the average rent for a one bedroom apartment in Toronto after eight years of your leadership, is two thousand five hundred dollars a month. That's more than a one hundred percent increase since you took office and you've done apps absolutely nothing to incentivize the construction of new and affordable homes for our young people. If you don't believe me, Justin, go to the food banks. Where one point five million people go to eat in a given month. Stay around long enough. You might hear from some of the people who come to the food bank asking for help getting medical assistance and dying, not because they're sick. But because they're too poor and too miserable after eight years of your leadership to go on living like this. If you don't believe me, Justin, go talk to the families of the thirty thousand people who've lost a loved one to drug overdoses. After you favored policies that flooded our streets with heroin and fentanyl, and you tied the hands of our police and prevented them from doing anything about it. After you failed to hold the scumbag corporations who brought these drugs to our streets accountable, Companies, companies like Mackenzie, Mr. Trudeau, companies to whom you continue to give hundred million dollars worth of contracts. Mister Trudeau, if you don't believe me, go to the now permanent incountments that have taken over large parts of formerly prosperous and bus ling communities in our cities like Vancouver, Toronto, and Peterborough. You don't believe me? Take a trip to the city transit, mister Trudeau, in Toronto. Where forty homeless people are forced to spend the night because your policies have made it impossible for them to get home. Where crime now rages out of control and women say they are afraid to even get on the train. June seventeenth, the Toronto trade at TTC, a woman in her twenties, died of her injuries after she was set on fire. December eighth, a fatal stabbing. On on line two train at High Park, station left a thirty one year old woman dead and injured. The suspect was wielding an iced pick. You don't believe me, mister Trudeau, get on one of those trains and talk to the people who will you the story of a woman who was stabbed in the head and face on a Spadina Street car. Just south of Bloor Street, she was taken to hospital with life altering injuries. These are not one off stories, Justin. Crime is up thirty two percent since you took off as violent, gang crime, up ninety two percent after eight years in office. You are responsible for the criminal code for the borders that bring in the illegal guns. You are responsible for our national police force. And after eight years, you have given You have given Canadian cities that are turning into crime zones. This is your record, mister Trudeau. Meanwhile, illegal border crossings have exploded, crossings that were almost unheard of when you took office. This is eight years. You told us that better was always possible and yet everything is worse and you blame everyone else. Can we know what you will do this session of parliament? You will divide to distract. You'll try to make people afraid of each other because you think that if an average Canadian is afraid of his neighbor, You'll forget that he can't feed himself or pay the rent. You'll try to take all the responsibility off of yourself and to put it on others. You'll claim you have nothing to do with any of these files as though as a federal prime minister, you're not responsible for the federal criminal code. As a federal prime minister, you're not responsible for the Aonic Federal Airports. That as a federal prime minister, you're not responsible for the half trillion dollars of federal debt that you have added that led to a forty year high in inflation. If you're not responsible for any of these things, if you can't do anything about it, then why don't you get out of and let someone lead who can.

When I look on the doorbell camera, I can see, you know, he actually has a whip. So I just, you know, swing the door open. I'm like, you know, what's going on? You know, you need to leave. The family says this started thursday after school when their daughter and the neighborhood boy were walking back home. There's one particular kid that was hitting the girls with the skateboard and she retaliated and hit him back. Um, one of the other kids pushed him in some water, like pushed him from behind. Um, he failed and took a puddle of water when he got up. The first person he's seen was our daughter. So he assumed that she did it. They also claim this scratch on the car was also from the whip. It's a deep scratch and not something that you could fill in or buff away. When does area Nash walked over to confront the boy's dad about this. As soon as he opens the door, I see that he has a weapon behind his back and he's leaning up against the doorway.
7235400793904385306~1~Leonarda Cianciulli, Soap-Maker of Correggio. #leonardacianciulli #horrortok #horror #serialkiller #corregio~I poisoned my victims, made them into soaps and cookies, and distributed them in the neighborhood. I am Leonida Chancile, better known as the soap maker of caregio. I was born in Montela, Italy, on November fourteenth eighteen ninety three. At the age of twenty one, I married Rafael Pennsardi with whom I had four children. But when my unemployed husband became an alcoholic over the years, I left him. However, this was not to be my only stroke of fate. When my favorite child and eldest son Giuseppe was called up for military service, I could no longer find peace out of fear for his life. I developed a secret and creepy plan that involved making human sacrifices to protect my son from any evil that lay ahead during the war. Divination and terror cards were the perfect way to attract act future victims. I decided to act and invited friends from the neighborhood over for tea and cake. My first victim was my friend, fuss Dina Seti. When she came over one day, I offered her glass of wine. In this glass, I had previously dissolved sleeping pills. When Faustina fell asleep, I took an ax and cut her body into nine pieces. I threw the pieces into a cauldron, added seven kilograms of sodium hydroxide side and stirred until it was a dark, thick mass. From this, I made a soap, which I later sold in my small store. With the victim's blood, I waited until it had coagulated and put it in the oven to dry. Then I mixed it with flour, sugar, chocolate, milk, and eggs. Lots of crispy cookies were baked from it, which I distributed to the next guests and visitors. I myself and my children also aid from them. In the same way, I later killed my two other friends before processing their bodies. Again, I distributed the bars of soap and cookies as gifts to neighbors and acquaintances. But when the sister of my last victim became concerned about her sister's whereabouts, she contacted the police. Since she was last seen in front of my house, the police eventually searched the house where they found the jewelry of the victim. I was arrested and after confessing, sentenced to thirty years in prison followed by three years a care facility for the mentally disabled. Of this sentence, I served only twenty four years. Because on October fifteenth nineteen seventy, at the age of seventy seven, I died in potashwale prison after suffering a stroke. Some of the objects, such as the ax and the cauldron that served as murder weapons and instruments, can still be seen today in the criminal museum in Rome.

7238025918378183962~1~Florida Couple say the daughter they adopted was actually an adult woman. #fy #fyp #foryou #foryoupage #florida #adoption #adopt #adoptionstory #adoptionjourney #adoptionstories ~Headlines around the world as this child, a child, or a grown woman. A Florida couple say they were duped into adopting her from Ukraine. THEY CLAIMED THEY WERE TOLD SHE WAS ONLY six YEARS OLD. BUT THEN THEY SAY RED FLAGS STARTED TO POP UP, LEADING THEM TO BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS MUCH OLDER. ON TOP OF THAT, THE CHILD'S ADOPTED FATHER TELLS OUR STEVEN FAVIAN SHE THREATENED TO KILL HIS FAMILY. IS THIS THE FACE OF A CHILD OR A WOMAN posing as a child. Her name is Natalia, and in twenty ten, she was adopted by Michael and Christine Barnett. They were told she was originally from New great and was afflicted with the form of dwarfism. How old do you think she is at the time? Okay. At that moment, six. But questions about Natalia's age surfaced the first night they brought her home. Barnett was urgently called into the bath room by his wife who was bathing Natalia. She's got this look on her face. She's, why does it go? She's scared? And she just says, look. You think you have a six year old in your house, and there are signs that she's already gone through puberty, which would make her much older than have six years old. Yeah. And they say there was something else. She's got a monthly cycle and she's hiding it. And I'm stunned. There was another red flag. Technically, she is a Ukrainian adoptee. She's never spoken a word of it. Doesn't have a hint of an accent. Hello and happy Thanksgiving. The family already had three sons. One son Jake is a mad genius who was profiled on sixty minutes in twenty well. In the segment, you can see Natalia sitting at the dinner table with the rest of the family. She attempted to kill Christine twice. According to Barnett, Natalia allegedly tried to poison his wife with a household cleaning product. Pine saw She had poured the pints on her coffee. She just says blatantly, plainly no emotion. I'm trying to kill you. I want you dead. Barnat says Natalia expressed the desire to stab the entire family in their sleep. It was at that point that the Barnett said they had enough. They decided to move and start a new life without their adopted daughter. THEY PACKED UP THEIR LIVES AND HEADED NORTH OF THE BORD TO CANADA BUT THEY LEFT NATALIA DEFEND FOR HERself ALL ALONE AT THIS APARTMENT IN LOPHIA, INDiana. The Barnett's paid a year's rent for Natalia. He says Natalia is capable of taking care of herself since in his opinion, she is an adult pretending to be a child. Barnat's lawyer, Karen Skennard. We have done a massive amount of research on this, looking at historical records, medical records, or and it's apparent that, hey, this person is an adult and always has been when she was in the care of the bar nets. The bar nets face two counts of felony neglect. Charges that they say miss the point entirely. Do you have any doubts that Natalia is an adult? Absolutely not. There there's no doubt whatsoever.

I'm from Virginia, and I'm an extreme couponer. A packet of noodles retails for $1 each, and thanks to Brenda's $1 coupons, she can receive them for free. So here we have this milk powder, which is $1.46. And because I have six 73-cent coupons, I can get three of them. After months of collecting coupons and a 10-hour shop at the grocery store, we will see if Brenda has calculated everything correctly. Your total will be $496.63. And I'd like to make my purchase with 200 coupons. As the cashier scans the coupons, Brenda gets more and more anxious about the total. And your new total is $0.00. It was another successful shopping day for Brenda. I'm so happy to be leaving the store with a total of $0.00. We did it again.

7216898268062633259~1~Culture shocks visiting Puerto Rico as a Chicago Puerto Rican. #puertorico #pr #cultureshock #puertoricotravel #isladelencanto #greenscreen ~Here's a list of things I learned in Puerto Rico. I've only been here for about a week. I'm just on vacation. I don't live here but there are so many things that literally caught me by surprise, and this is my list. Did you know that roosters don't only crow in the morning? They grow all day, all day, night, all day. Annoying. There are no self-service gas stations, at least none that I found, and I have a problem. First of all, how do I tell them that I wanna fill to the top? I went to a gas station and I kept trying to tell him a compliment or a total. Whoever I my words were not wording, and he just kept asking me how much how much to put on it. And finally, I was like, what in that forty? What we'll see what I get. But I have to return the rental car and it has to be full, so how am I gonna do this? Anyway, next is guess is quoted in liters. I got here and I went to the gas station. I'm like, oh my god, this is so cheap. It was like eighty seven cents per liter. Not per gallon. It's still almost four dollars a gallon. Puerto Rican restaurants in Illinois are not the same as Puerto Rican restaurants here. All the little things that were used to get like a bunch of I haven't seen nothing here. Nothing. It's more here. I will say Scratch back. I will say here, I'm in a savannah. It's mofungo all day. Every place has mofungal. Every place you're gonna find, they're gonna have mofungal. But what they don't have? Target. I feel so bad for them. There's no target here on the island at all. There's Wal Mart's galore, but Target. Noise. Hot water. This one is weird to me. This is the shower where I am. For some reason, I always thought if something was plugged in, you're not supposed take it by the shower, the bath of the water. Well, not here because that's how their water is heated. There's no hot water in the kitchen to wash dishes in the regular sinks snow. Only in the showers and they're plugged in. Next, cash is king. A lot of places take my regular debit card but there are some places that only accept cash and an ATH card, which is apparently a Caribbean and Puerto Rican island. It's like a dip it's like their debit card. And they will only accept this in cash and that sucks like an ice cream truck. I didn't have enough cash, so damn it. Last one's slow. They're on their own time. They'll get to you when they get to you.

Ain't no way they actually have a Scrub Daddy at Target, bro, for $4? When you could just buy them in the TikTok shop? All right, bet. I guess I'm gonna buy it and compare it with the ones from the TikTok shop. Let's go. So this is the Scrub Daddy that we got from the TikTok shop. And this is the one that we got from Target. And as you can see already, the coloring from Target is so dull. It don't even look like a Scrub Daddy. Like, this is the right yellow and right consistency. I don't know why anyone would ever go to a Target. Now let's do a durability test. All right. One, two. From the TikTok shop, don't forget. Oh! Very durable. Now, let's try yours. Ain't no way you just ripped that in half. And you aren't even as strong as me. The one from the TikTok shop, I was going full force. She looked like she wasn't even trying and ripped this one up from Target. This ain't no Scrub Daddy no more. Why would you even go to Target to buy this cheap-ass scrub, bro? Get you one from the TikTok shop that's more reliable and more trustworthy.

He was later executed in front of a crowd of 3,000 people.

7236396424550681902~0~Has anyone else had this happen? Because my car is nowhere to be found~Okay. So I'm convinced that my car is cursed because, like, two or three years ago, I bought this like Toyota RAV four just a totally normal silver Toyota RAV4. And, like, immediately, within having it in a month, I was t boned and it was not my fault, and then I ended up, like, you know, having to go through a holy little battle, it was fine. They fixed my car. I'm like, okay. Since then, it has been hit like four times. It is constantly rear ended. I'll just be sitting out of light someone flies up and rear ends me. Like, it's parked on the street. Someone just, like, gets in a major accident and slams into my car. So the other day, I woke up. To, like, this weird sound and I looked out the window and, like, a car had hit another car that hit another car that was then under my car. So I was like, Literally, I had just been talking the day before about how my car was cursed, and I was like, what is happening? So, of course, I have to get online. On the call, I'll call up the the insurance people. And I'm like, hey, guys. Like, this is ridiculous. So, like, your car may be tunneling. We have to get an appraiser out there. So they out, they look at, like, no, no, we can fix this. So they said, not like a tall guy. And of course, the tall guy is, like, mad creepy. Like, asking for my number, being weird. I'm, like, I am I am engaged. Leave me alone. Also just leave me alone. I'm not showing any interest. I made my pajamas and my car got hit. Can you just not? Anyways, it was very stressful, so I didn't wanna drive with him because he was just being, like, super weird. And I had to go to work anyways and, like, get a rental car. So I was, like, can you just drop this off at the shop? Made sure he had the right address. I sent it on its merry way with the keys. All good. It's fine. And this is why I should listen to my freaking mom because she always says, like, wait, before you send your car away on a towel, like, get anything out of it. And I was like, I don't have that much valuable stuff, but I do have, like, CDs and just, like, stuff that is in my car. Right? And my cool little zebra I've like zebra floor mats and shit. I'm mad. Why am I mad? You might ask. Well, today, it's been a week. It's been like over a week and I called up the car shop to be like, hey, did we get, like, an estimate? Do you know when my car is gonna be ready? Because we move in, like, two weeks. And this rental car is, like, tiny And my car is big. And so I was like, hey, am I gonna get this back in, like, two, three weeks? And they were like, oh, yeah. We've been, like, waiting for your car to arrive because we got the germs checked the lake. Your car is not here. And I was like, my car is not there. I was like, what do you mean? They're like, yeah. Like, your car never arrived. I was like, it's got, like, a holographic Capricorn key chain. They're like, yeah, we definitely do not have that. So I caught up, got co. And I was like, excuse me, all my cars missing, and they were like, yeah, that toe is still technically in progress. And I was like, so weird to my car. They're like, I don't know. Like, it kinda says it was dropped off, but it says It was supposed, I don't know. So Daikou doesn't know where my car is. The telecom doesn't know where my car is. They're trying to figure it out. I'm not having to go to a classic car shop to try to, like, drive the road to see if there's somewhere else that may have been dropped off. But, like, What the heck? Anyways, my car is cursed, and I hope that we find it because it's missing.
7240828199612075307~1~Strange things about Chelsea Clinton's marriage #fyp #chelseaclinton #marriage #relationship #weird~Chelsea Clinton and Mark Masinski met his teenagers, became good friends and stayed that way throughout college. Eventually, they fell in love and tied the knot in a fabulous wedding in twenty ten. But has it been smooth sailing ever since? Here are some strange things about Chelsea Clinton's marriage. Six months after Chelsea and Mark tied the knot, the split rumor started swirling. New York CBS too alleged that their young marriage was, quote, collapsing under pressure from work and family. And that she was seeking an enrollment. The publication based this on the fact that Mark was in the middle of a break from his job as an investment banker in Wyoming, skiing while Chelsea stayed in Manhattan. However, one daily news gossip columnist claimed divorce wasn't in the card, saying, I think a lot of people are hoping that there's trouble between Chelsea and Mark. It's just not the case. They're still in love. Mark ski trip was a war crisis. During a twenty twelve vogue profile of Chelsea, her chief of staff that the Clinton Foundation said the tabloid gossip taught the couple a valuable lesson explaining none of it was true. But what put a strain on them was that the stories are being written because none of us were paying attention to it. It was an eye opening lesson. Chelsea realized, maybe I need to get out there and he mystify myself a little bit. Despite growing up with politician parents and enjoying arrears in private equity, Chelsea and Mark seemed to be polar opposites. In her twenty twelve vogue profile, readers got a glimpse into their personalities. Mark describes himself as Just a nerdy Jewish boy from Philly. But you know, Bill Clinton grew up with a dirt floor in Arkansas, so it's all relative. Chelsea's very much the yin to my yang. Don't want to say I'm aloof, but I definitely can exist in the cloud. I walk into parking meters. She's the antithesis of that. She's like, this is where the parking meters go. However, Mark being a bit of a self described airhead makes him that much more endearing to those in Chelsea Circle. One of Chelsea's best friends told the mag, these are real men. We were always rooting for them to get together. Chelsea's chief of staff for the Clinton Foundation agreed saying, he's this playful schoolboy stuck inside this wicked smart, really astute adult body. He's his happy goofing off as he is talking finance with world leaders. He's the best of both worlds. Another fun fact, Mark her up with eleven siblings. Chelsea, of course, grew up with a secret service. You can't order a pizza to the White House. I'll just tell you that right now. And and we did sometimes there were When you're the only child of a political dynasty, you can be assured that your wedding won't be a simple affair. Their wedding planner told today at the time it's going to be very understated, elegant, but befitting a royal wedding for the US understated. Chelsea and Mark's twenty ten wedding at New York's ass their court's estate reportedly cost up to five million dollars, including the fifteen thousand dollars worth of porta potties with porcelain toilets that any of their five hundred guests could visit according to TM's C. Guests at the lavish wedding included such mega stars as Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks according to the BBC. Additionally, citing a VIP moment, the Federal AV administration and forced a no fly zone over the Hudson River venue for a full twelve and a half hours according to NBC News four, New York. Mark makes his living as an investor, but there's one small problem. He can't seem to hold on to a job. According to deal breaker, a site that covers the financial industry, Mark seems to always fell upwards. After spending six years at Goldman Sachs, Chelsea's better half struck out in his own, and it wasn't great. He spent a few years at three g cap before going on his three month ski trip. Then decided to launch his own hedge fund, Igo Vail Partners. But according to The New York Times, the fun close two years later, after losing nearly ninety percent of the twenty five million dollars it raised from investors. A few months later, Mark took the vice chairman job at the investment firm, Social Capital, and he was there less than a year. In October twenty nineteen, he was hired as the managing director of the private equity firm, TPG. All of this wasn't from a lack of trying. Political reports that in a hacked email released by WikiLeaks, ex Clinton a Doug Band claimed that Mark leveraged his connection. With the Clinton's to raise money for his hedge fund. And also claimed that Chelsea was setting up meetings for her husband that resulted in investments from several major donors to Clinton Foundation and the Clinton campaigns. While Mark is still trying to find a job that lasts longer than a few years, he can also count on Chelsea to make sure the bills are paid. According to the New York Post, Chelsea made nine million dollars in salary and stock options since twenty eleven by sitting on the board of Internet investment firm IAC. In twenty seventeen, Chelsea joined the Board of Expedia Group earning an estimated two hundred fifty thousand dollars. And despite having no TV journalism or any journalism experience, political reports that Chelsea earned an annual salary of six hundred thousand dollars at NBC News as a special correspondent. And apparently, it's all paying off. In twenty thirteen, Chelsea and Mark moved into a ten million dollars New York City apartment described as a luxury fortress by The New York Daily News. According to The Daily Mail, the five thousand square foot apartment is the longest apartment in the city.

7227886983039814939~1~Credit:Tyler Oliveira! Follow For Part 2 💙 #fy #xyzbca #bermuda #bermudatriangle #mystery #investigate #investigation ~Me on top of a sunken ship in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle trying to figure out why boats, planes, and ships. A rumor to sink, crash, and disappear here. The first to get here, I'd fly to Bermuda via plane. Alright. We're doing this. Everything was going great until we hit unexpected turbulence. Thank you for your patience. Please remain seated with your seatbelt and carry the passenger. This is no joke. The triangles not to be played with or play with this. Must have just been ninety seven minutes straight of pure coincidental bad luck. Right? We had thirty minutes left, Randy God for a safe landing. What wasn't the Bermuda Triangle? Things were off to a suspicious start. The plane has landed. No plane crash. No casualties now. We need to investigate. We made it to Bermuda, beautiful island looking thing. I don't care. I'm here to just spell one myth is the triangle real and is a deadly. After surviving my flight, I waved down a taxi and headed towards the dockyard if any local fishermen here have seen anything unusual in the Triangle's waters. You know any fishermen? Well, cool as I fish myself, but really. Yeah. Yeah. I put a lot of games in the world, especially these days. First Marita, that's what I wanna talk to. I guess do I We're trying to see if this Bermuda Triangle met this real or not. Maybe you're good. We're gonna try and win big pro. Hey, Big pro. You come runner and see some name. This is someone who lost your life. This guy's lost his sea. This is your guys friend. Yes. What happened? We did. I never sir. Never reach What happened, though? It's water bottle. You'll be back in domestic waters. Yeah. Actually, I ain't joking. People don't misinterpret. You never find nothing that day you've been serious. Yeah. It's right very serious. I know it's my brother-in-law. The guy was so strong. He attacked their fish and day, Friday. It's great. Vote, planes, ships, and everything. I've been missing. You would say the Bermuda Triangle has some legitimacy. Yes. Was that It's real. Yeah? It's real. Okay. You get spooked out there? Talk to us. Yeah. Alright. See you guys. Bye. For hearing from people who had lost loved one to the triangle savagery, another taxi driver took me to a local monument where he said I'd understand how serious the locals treated a triangle here. They get a little mini documentary on the Bermuda Triangle. Well, whether you believe in it or not, I had a person experience ten miles off the meter and weather change in an instant before we were coming back to the island when we were going away from the island. Okay? And if there wasn't for some fishermen that were coming in, we would have end up being lost at sea. So I believe that there's an energy force in certain parts of the world. That is unexplained. From me the triangle being one. So the evidence is there. And I've seen many things happen. Giant squid? That Oh, could it have swallowed your boat? Oh, man. Cool. That's too much. There's only so much of you know when it concerns me. Think about it. How far can you go down? And then my taxi driver led me to a monument depicting a sunken ship that commemorated countless lives lost at sea over the last five centuries.

Dude, Dwayne Johnson vs. The Rock. Two fucking titans going against each other. You know man, when I was younger I used to think they were the same person, but how stupid am I? Anyways, Dwayne Johnson vs. The Rock is actually a really good matchup. They both have the same type of body, the same weight, the same power in their arms and legs. Normally I would call it a stalemate, but there's one difference between The Rock and Dwayne Johnson. Dwayne Johnson is just a movie star. The Rock has 17 title wins, which is 17 more than Dwayne Johnson has. The Rock is a 10-time world champion, a 5-time tag team champion, a 2-time intercontinental champion, and the other prestigious matches that he's been in in his career that he's won like the Royal Rumble. Yeah, in conclusion, with all of that under The Rock's belt, Dwayne Johnson stands absolutely no chance. Although both of them have the same body type, the same strength, and the same speed, The Rock just has more experience than Dwayne Johnson does, and therefore The Rock will win.

Okay, so here we have our 12 fake globels. They are nowhere near as good as the real ones. Um, they don't stick together as well, but they're still kind of good. Let's see how they are if you throw them at the ceiling. Okay, so literally none of them have fallen down. So maybe they are kind of sticky. Uh, I'm gonna have to get the- oh shoot.

Did you find a new one or something? Yeah. And I just want to make sure it tastes good. You should have changed it up. The last one was good. Well, I just want to... I know you like it pretty salty, so I just want to know if it needs more blow on it. It might be kind of hot. Or maybe it needs less. I don't know. You just taste it. Is it... Um... Is it good? Are you okay? Maybe a little less salt. A little less salt? Yeah, just like... It's kind of salty. But overall, like, pretty good. Just a less... Just... I mean, the flavor's good, but... Yeah. Maybe add some milk or something? Could you do that? Milk? Yeah, maybe to like... It's just kind of... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's just kind of salty a little. But you did good. You did good, baby. But just a little. So... I know everyone else, though, likes it pretty salty, so maybe I should just leave it. No. I would add some milk, baby. Milk?! Or something to kind of lessen the salt flavor. It's good. The flavor's there, baby. The flavor's there. I think I'm just... I think I'm just gonna leave it. Everyone else likes it pretty salty. Okay. Um... Do you think it'll be okay? Well... Maybe if we mix it in with, like, some noodles. Noodles! You think it'll taste fine? I think it's a little too salty. But I'm not trying to be mean. I just think it's a little too salty. Okay. So just... I'll fix it.

6875405441472498949~1~Reply to @jessca4765 #foryoupage #fyp #foryou #powerlifting #bodybuilding #deadlift #fitness #workout #fittok #powertok~Why do metal plates feel heavier than non-metal plates? Well, there's two reasons for this. If we're talking about, you know, strictly traditional cast iron plates, they are somewhat chiefly manufactured because they don't have to go through a calibration process, so there could be a plus or minus five difference in weight. So a 45-pound plate could easily weigh anywhere from 40 to 50 pounds, and I've even seen more extremes with like 53 pounds. So that could be one reason. Number two, if we're talking about steel calibrated plates, would I use for powerlifting? Probably because it is a smaller plate. Um, there's not as much surface area being covered, so everything is, you know, condensed into that one surface area. Now, if we're talking, you know, rubber plates, you know, what they use in CrossFit, for example, because there is more weight distribution, or rather there's more surface area for the weight distribution, so we'll say a 45-pound plate, for example, it has the potential to feel a little, like, less heavy or a little lighter than a steel calibrated plate, for example. But at the end of the day, weight's weight.

Well keep in mind I actually use two different belts. I use an SBD belt for my squats because it is a heftier belt and I prefer setting it a little bit lower. For some reason it's easier on my hip that way and also keep in mind I've got a short a shorter torso than most people but that's about where I like to set it during squats. Sassy belt flip. For deadlifts I use my A7 belt because it is a little bit of a looser belt and I prefer setting it higher actually because it allows me to get into a much better position that way and also I like having this looser for deadlifts than I do for squats again just because it allows me to get to a better position. So yeah that's where I set my belts.

6877301356101782785~1~Nasty burn with these #fyp #foryou #foryoupage #gymshark #fitness #bodybuilder #gains #workout #legday~Alrighty, so this is a great supplementary exercise to target the quads and build some mass. As with every muscle group, I think it's most efficient to implement both high and low reps, so I wouldn't say this should replace squats in their variations, but I do think it's a great finisher or accessory. Additionally, I can't see it being sustainable to go heavy with as it puts the knees in a very stressed position and will be hard on the tendons with heavier weight. That being said, the Smith machine allows you to forget about balance so you can push your knees way out over your toes and therefore lengthen the quads through their full range of motion. It's great for time under tension and metabolic fatigue and you can really produce some mechanical tension which is the primary driver of muscle growth because you can arguably go to failure more safely. It is important to make sure you keep the stretch entirely on the quads by not going so deep that your back has to round because at that point your lower back and hips will start to sustain the load. Mess around with your feet positioning a little bit and find out where it feels the best so you can get the best contraction and pump.
6877726677334510849~1~It isn’t just for lazy trouts #fyp #foryou #foryoupage #fitness #supplements #gains #gymshark #bodybuilder #preworkout~Due to variances in tolerance, preferences, ingredients, regulations, etc, it's impossible to say what the best pre-workout is for everybody. However, with that being said, I will try to explain the ingredients that you should look for when buying a pre-workout. I think pre-workout definitely has its place, but it's important to note that you shouldn't rely on it or use it to make up for bad recovery practices. The dosage of all these ingredients has a range, and I think it's likely better to start small so that you don't fuse up your tolerance right away. Depending on whether or not you're looking for a pre-workout that has stimulants in it, caffeine is probably the number one ingredient you should keep an eye out for. The second ingredient you should look out for is citrulline and its derivatives. It improves the ammonia recycling process as well as nitric oxide metabolism. In other words, it gives you a nasty pump and improves endurance by providing the muscles with more nutrients throughout the workout. Number three is beta-alanine, and this is what gives you the tingles. It improves muscular endurance in higher rep sets by buffering the production of lactic acid.
6878834531911224577~1~Hope this changes your life #fyp #foryou #foryoupage #fitness #gymshark #bodybuilder #nutrition #diet~All right, I'm about to let you in on a groundbreaking secret to portion control. Now just like the next guy, I frigging hate doing dishes, hate it. So in an effort to mitigate the dishes that I create, for certain foods such as yogurt that I do like to measure my portions of, you put it on the scale and then you eat out of the container on the scale. And then, say you want to eat 200 grams, once the number gets to negative 200 grams, you know that you've taken 200 grams worth of yogurt out of the container. The sad part about this is that it actually took me a little while and a lot of dirty dishes to figure this out. So maybe you're one of those people too and I just helped you out a little bit.
6878841351916637441~1~My triceps suck but these have helped #fyp #foryou #foryoupage #fitness #gymshark #naruto #bodybuilder #strength~If you want a big bench and arms that look thick while wearing even a loose t-shirt, you need to focus on building the medial head of the tricep. The part of your tricep that is closest to the elbow. Triceps are seriously underestimated by most people when it comes to bench strength. Matt Wenning and Louis Simmons both preach this and they know what they're talking about to say the least. Due to the length tension relationship and where the different heads of the tricep attach, my favorite exercise to target the medial head of the tricep is decline dumbbell skull crushes. The dumbbell should start somewhere around your ear and end up in line with your forehead, but play around with it until you feel the contraction by your elbow.
6879055195330858245~1~Take it day by day! #foryoupage #fyp #foryou #powerlifting #bodybuilding #squat #fitness #workout #fittok #powertok~I figured I would put up a squat video since you guys haven't seen one in a long time. This is just 474lbs, my relatively light single from the other night, and this is 89lbs below my best, but it's not about the weight on the bar. It's more dealing with an injury or getting back into the gym after dealing with an injury. Always appreciate the little victories. This is the first time in a while where I had absolutely no pain while squatting, and it's the happiest I've been for a squat session in a very, very long time. So the weight's not going to come back immediately. The important thing is, how's your comfort level in the gym? How's your pain level in the gym? If it starts to dissipate over time, then you're on the right track. Just take it day by day.

6879902533876337925~1~Reply to @man_myth_legend0 #foryoupage #fyp #foryou #powerlifting #bodybuilding #squat #fitness #workout #fittok #powertok~This question is actually coming up a lot on the video that I most recently put up and I want to reiterate, I'm glad he's okay, he just needs to learn how to, one, lower the weight, two, squat properly, and three, spotter arms or get a spotter, but what do I mean by let the bar settle? What I'll see a lot of people do, especially beginners, when they go for a squat, they'll just unrack Mach 5 and they won't let the bar just settle. There's really no better way for me to put it. So this is what it looks like. Just get underneath, still moving around and everything, and this could lead to an injury because it's a lot of weight that you're going to be moving, you want it to be still. So to settle the bar, for a high bar for example, get underneath, get set, wait for it to stop moving, it's settled, then step backwards, breathe, let it settle, squat.
6879936527829404933~1~@sheismarissamatthews #greenscreenvideo #foryoupage #fyp #foryou #powerlifting #bodybuilding #deadlift #fitness #workout #fittok #powertok~i want to preface this video by saying please don't go to her page and attack her. this video is not being made out of malicious intent, and look, i support body positivity. girl, you can do what you want, but you can't just say that diets flat out don't work. i'm gonna put this in very simple terms. yes, a calorie deficit is not meant to be sustained for a long time. it's just supposed to be something temporary, right, until a person reaches their goal weight, for example. it's up to them with what they want to do after that. there are all these studies that are saying, oh, all the people that lost weight, they ended up gaining it back in the long term. that's really on the people when you think about it. they didn't want to put in the work to keep the weight off. just like people are giving you the respect for being body positive, you shouldn't be demonizing people that want to at least try dieting. if your only goal is to lose weight, you might gain it back in the long term. the thing is you need to adapt fitness and health as a lifestyle.
6879952519586450690~1~It’s a no from me. Be smart and work hard #fyp #foryou #foryoupage #gymshark #fitness #bodybuilder #supplements~So I'm getting a lot of people asking about or recommending the use of sarms and secretogogues in my comments, and I wanted to touch on that. Also known as selective androgenic receptor modulators, sarms are hailed as the next generation of anabolic steroids due to yielding similar results without the side effects. This is not true. For starters, they're essentially a completely unregulated industry, and according to Dr. Bill Llewellyn, you likely will not get what you paid for. With that being said, on the off chance that you do get what you paid for, the risks are unknown. I don't know much about them, because nobody does. Regardless of what anybody might tell you, there is minimal literature to support a particular stance within one way or the other, so it's impossible to know much, if anything at all. For example, James English of Gymshark recently said on Instagram Live that his blood work was negatively affected by taking sarms, even though the common but false narrative says that that won't happen.
6903934953705245954~1~Reply to @g3ck059 can also be done with bands #fitness #exercise #muscle #chest #workout #pecs~So if you don't have much weight push-ups are going to be your main exercise and that's okay Push-ups can take you pretty darn far. One thing you can add That doesn't require a lot of weight. This is just 10 pounds Is an upper chest V or UCV raise and I'm just gonna bring my arm up along the chest Almost like I'm trying to kiss my bicep And I know I've got to hold my beard out of the way but you can actually take your hand and put it up here along the clavicle and you can feel that contraction in the upper head of the pec and If you want to vary it up, you can do slow eccentrics up and slow down And this is going to help work that upper area that you might miss a bit with the push-ups

About two days ago, the rest of my baby axolotls hatched and I started a hatchery. Then a big axolotl creator here on TikTok responded, and she said I was doing a ton of stuff wrong. She was super kind about it and it was so helpful. Firstly, I was using Aquasave, which she told me was toxic. But prior to using the Aquasave, I'd actually done a lot of research on it myself. And I read here on a thread that someone had actually phoned the company and it didn't contain iodine. Although it may be a different type of Aquasave that contains iodine, I don't know. But it's better to be safe than sorry. In actual fact, I actually had a bottle of this other Aquasave on the way. But after watching her video and seeing the urgency on the matter, I decided to go buy some today. So basically, I'm going to have double everything. Next up, I was using fin rot and fungus control. And the better option is methylene blue. I knew methylene blue was the better option, but the supplier told me this is okay too. But I'm going to stop using this just in case. And then lastly, I tried to put that in the tank without a tube, which was super stupid. And if you check the comments of that video, I realized straight after. So there will be another hatchery video.

A couple things I'd work on is remember to keep your shoulder blades squeezed back because I noticed how you'd squeeze them back and as soon as you start pulling, you'd kind of unsqueeze them. Another thing to work on is work on a little hip mobility, it looks like you need to get down a little bit more to get in a better position. And remember to keep your butt down because I could see you picking up just a little bit before you would start the whole movement. Other than that man, great work and keep pushing yourself dude.

Some cool things about this bomber plane is the fact that this plane can actually take off in about a second or two which is pretty cool. This plane also comes with bombs but the bomb capacity on this plane is around 50. This plane also has four engines which pretty much helps the plane go really quick. A neat feature about this plane is the fact that when you're flying at a certain height you can go off the radar. I only have two issues with this plane. The first issue with this plane is the fact that it takes up so much space in your hangar. I mean look at this you guys can see that it removed all of my planes and literally it doesn't make any sense. The second issue with this plane is whenever you request it in the interaction menu it always spawns it in the worst location. I mean look at this I can't even take off properly without running into something.

Since I have a very limited amount of time, I'm just going to answer the most common questions with creatine, the first being, is it a steroid? And no, it's not a steroid. If it was, we wouldn't be allowed to use it. It'd be much harder to purchase legally. You could just walk up to any vitamin shop or GNC and ask for creatine. They'll gladly sell it to you. No matter the form of creatine that is taken, its primary function is to increase the phosphocreatine source that are found in your muscles, and by doing so, you're also increasing the amount of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, that is produced. Long story short, supplementing with any form of creatine will cause a natural increase in your athletic performance. Now, I'm sure everyone wants to know, is creatine safe for teenagers? I get this question every day. Quite frankly, I think it is, but don't take my word for gospel. Just consult a professional. What I can tell you, though, is if your mom and dad still don't want you purchasing creatine, try convincing them to allow you to eat more red meat and fish, because another fun fact, creatine is naturally found in these protein sources. This has been.

But for everyone else, this is what I'd recommend. Develop two strike pitches and a chase pitch. What's a strike pitch? It's a pitch that starts as a strike and ends up as a strike. For me, that's my fastball, cutter, and changeup. See how they all start in the zone and they all finish in the zone? Strike pitches usually have less total movement, which makes them easier to tunnel. A chase pitch starts in the same tunnel as your strike pitches, but ends up as a ball. For me, it's my slider and my curveball. For example, here's a cutter and a slider. They look exactly the same, but one is a strike and one is a ball. So.

Choose the right pan. A non-stick, cast iron, or griddle works really well for the job. For a delicious golden brown surface and nice tall cake, you need an even, medium heat. Pancakes aren't supposed to be fried. All you need is a little thin layer of vegetable oil. To evenly portion out the pancakes, use a measuring cup. I use a quarter cup for my pancakes. The batter is thick, so to create a perfect circle, just use the back of a spoon or offset spatula. Cook until the edges set and you start to see bubbles break through the surface. And also check for a golden brown underside. Now you're ready to flip. To prevent the raw batter from smearing all over the pan, just hold the spatula about three inches above the pan and do a quick turn. Tip number seven, do not press down with the spatula. You're going to press out all those gorgeous air bubbles, resulting in a really thin and chewy pancake. Tall and fluffy is what we want.

Vaping is the healthiest way to deliver nicotine into your body. Sure. Did you know that way back in the day when cigarettes first came out they were being advertised as healthy for you? Yeah, it was the easiest way to sell nicotine and make money. Doctors everywhere were going, got a headache? Smoke a cigarette. Stomach ache? You should smoke a cigarette. Cough, sore throat? You should definitely smoke some cigarettes. It wasn't until 50 years later that people finally started to believe cigarettes could kill. And that's because by then enough dead bodies had piled up for researchers to cut open and say, hey look at that. They all died from the same thing. 50 years. Vaping is only 20 years old. Still a baby. Not enough dead bodies to provide any significant data. But I bet you in 30 years there will be. Because that dead body is going to be yours. If you think inhaling anything but good quality air into your lungs is healthy for you, you are one dumb motherfucker.

If you're stuck in an elevator, do not try to pry the door open and wiggle yourself out. Because that will upset the equilibrium and you will be crushed. Number 2. If you notice a car is following you, do not try to go to your house. You need to make 4 right turns in a row to see if they're actually following you. But if they are following you, you need to go to a police station immediately. Number 3. If you're outside during a thunderstorm and your hair starts doing this, you need to seek shelter as fast as you can because you're about to be struck by lightning.

Yeah, that works. There's a lot of ways to get rid of the hiccups, but one way that I stick by because it resets your diaphragm is sticking a pen in your mouth and then drinking some water. Make me hiccup. My dad was a beekeeper for a little bit, so I got to learn about all the benefits from raw honey. And one thing that it can do is actually get rid of acne scars.

The first step is to record your phone, put it on the dashboard, roll down your window, put your hands on the steering wheel. You're not going to make any sudden movements until you talk to the police because you don't want them to think that you're hiding something. And then you're going to say this. Officer, my driver's license is in my pocket. Is it OK if I reach for it? Now's a good time to inform the officer that you're recording this conversation. Sir, I am recording this conversation on my phone, which is located on the dashboard. If the police order you out of the car, you have to get out of the car, but that doesn't necessarily give them the right to search your car. We'll get out of the car. Before I do, I will roll up my window and pick up my phone that's on the dashboard and continue recording this conversation. You have no obligation to talk to the officer about your day. So this is what you say if they start asking you questions. Sir, again, I would not answer any questions unless I have my lawyer present. Best tip I can give is make sure you're respectful to the officer and make them feel safe. That will better increase your chances of having a successful interaction.

Beruang normalnya tidak menyerang manusia, kecuali mereka sangat lapar atau kalian terlalu dekat dengan anaknya. Jangan pernah kalian melarikan diri karena beruang akan melihat kalian sebagai mangsa. Dan ingat, beruang adalah pelari dan pemanjat yang handal. Mereka bisa berlari hingga 50 km per jam dan mengehap kalian. Jika itu beruang coklat atau grizzly, kalian harus pura-pura mati karena mereka hanya menyerang jika terancam. Dan jika melihat musuhnya sudah mati, mereka akan pergi. Jika itu beruang hitam, jangan pura-pura mati, lawan balik. Lempar batu atau kayu, tunjukkan siapa yang lebih kuat karena mereka sebenarnya takut dengan manusia. Jika itu beruang kutub, menyerahlah. Kalian harus jauhi habitatnya karena mereka tidak takut siapapun, bahkan sampai memburu manusia. Dan itulah mengapa orang-orang yang tinggal di kutub utara selalu membawa senapan kemanapun mereka pergi. Ada pepatah, jika itu coklat, berbalinglah. Jika itu hitam, lawan balik. Dan jika itu putih, selamat tidur.

After watching a bunch of tutorials, I realized that they only use like two ingredients and the results aren't that good so I thought why not combine all the tutorials and use every ingredient recommended. Almost forgot the baking soda but you're gonna add around this much. Then you put the case in and shake it around. Next is some laundry pre-wash. I put in like 11 sprays. For step 4, throw in the laundry detergent. Step 5, you might want to cover your nose with apple cider vinegar. Number 6, put in two shots of mouthwash. Five more sprays of laundry pre-wash and for the last ingredient, some water. Then top it off with two paper towels to let the case really soak in the ingredients. Shake it around and leave it for a day. I'll be posting the results in 24 hours.

So, uh, follow me. Rat the fire. Clip your fingernails and keep them clean with a nail brush. If you're doing something with a lot of walking or physical activity, put baby powder in your butt crack. Not in the hole, but like, you know, in the crack. Keep a separate shampoo and conditioner and don't use a two-in-one. When you finally move out or you live in a dorm, get some menstrual products for your friends who get a period. It's important to have a facial cleanser and then follow it up with a moisturizing cream. If you're going outside, get yourself some facial sunscreen. Buy what you can in bulk because it'll make your life so much easier down the line. And before you go on a date, you're going to want to scrape your tongue, floss your teeth, brush your teeth, and then use your preferred mouthwash. That's the killer routine. Good luck, guys.

This allows for your phone to bring in the most amount of light possible, so your stars come out clear.

6843822091402267910~1~HOW TO MAKE YOUR VAG SMELL/TASTE BETTER PT. 2 #fyp #foryou #tips #advice~This is how to make your vagina smell and taste better part 2. So now that we've gone over that, let's talk about some actual tips to make it smell and taste better. 1. Wash your vulva. These are the outer parts of your vagina. Everything that you can see down there. Not the inside. You can wash your vulva with water. Just don't wash the inside of it. Wear cotton underwear so your vagina can breathe. Avoid smoking and don't drink as much. Use non-porous sex toys. Porous sex toys have little holes that can collect bacteria and give your vagina an infection. Drink more water. Just like your pee, if you don't drink enough water, it can become concentrated and smelly. If you're trying to make your vagina taste or smell better because your partner is telling you to, if he's saying that he's not going to give you head because it tastes bad, that isn't okay and we'll talk about it further in the next video.

If you are 35 or younger and you are experiencing chest pains, it's most likely not a heart attack. Now, I'm not saying it can't happen. If you smoke a pack of cigarettes every day starting at 18, yeah, you'll probably have a heart attack, motherfucker. But if this isn't you, because you're a smart motherfucker, then it's more likely one of these three things. Number one, stress and anxiety, which is easy to understand given the fucked up year we've had. Reason number two, you pull the muscle. It needs rest. Maybe some ice. And my favorite, reason number three, you smoke too much weed. Lay off the ganja. It's freaking you out. If you've had chest pains from any one of these three things, comment below. Tell me I'm right. It wasn't a heart attack. If you had had a heart attack before 35, that's wild. Comment below. Let's learn about it.

De la punta de la nariz recto hacia arriba, allí deberían comenzar tus cejas. Ahora nos vamos a guiar también de la punta de la nariz, pero lápiz lo vamos a poner en diagonal. Pasando por la mitad del ojo, allí debería estar el arco de tu ceja, la parte curva de la ceja. Finalmente, guiándonos de la fosa nasal, pasando por la última pestaña, en diagonal, allí debería terminar tu ceja. Ahora vamos a definir el ancho de nuestra ceja. Comienza desde la parte inicial y no lo hagas tan pegado. Recuerda que necesitamos un diseño. Si lo haces muy al ras de tu ceja natural, cuando depiles probablemente quites de más. Hazlo un poquito más ancho para que puedas tener holgura al depilar. Define la parte de arriba y la parte de abajo. Este sería el diseño de tu ceja. Like y sígueme para enseñarte a depilarla.

7193312608022187307~1~90% of drivers are troubled by this problem!#tiktok#howto#cartok#car#automotive#driving#skills#knowledge#fpy#fyp#tips~Clearly there is an empty parking space, but there are cars in front and behind. Stumped many people. Remember my three words. No more fear of side parking. Let's drive the car parallel first. When the ears of the car are aligned with the front car, turn the steering wheel to the right and reverse the car. When we're in the left rear-view mirror, just when you see the right headlight of the car behind you, turn the steering wheel back. Keep going backwards. When we were in the right rear-view mirror, seize the door handle and curb. Cross together. Turn the steering wheel to the left and fall back. This way the car enters the parking space smoothly.

It's not for you Don't worry. Keep a bottle of poop spray in your bathroom This is poopery and I just put it in this little bottle but use whichever kind you want I also think it's a great idea to have a little coochie container in your bathroom for anyone who might need to tampon or Unscented wet wipes are crucial because if you're trying to get down and eat bro, like you get come on I think it's a good idea to always have a speaker in the bathroom that way in case anybody's dropping number two and they're a Guest, you know, they can play some music so that you're not listening I sell their water and cotton round so she can remove her makeup before going to bed Oh and you shampoo and conditioner not a two-in-one when I almost forgot Why don't you guys go and say a happy Father's Day to your dad because after all he taught you how to be the most Hygienic young man, you could be I don't wait.

Old Japanese businessmen. I've had three notable accounts with them. The first one, an old Japanese man decided to grab my bra in public. Number two, I was shopping in the Ikebukuro and some random man came up to me, grabbed my hand and started pulling me towards a bar saying, asobanai? Three, I've had many incidents of men groping me on the train in Japan, but one in particular that stands out is when a man decided to touch my inner legs pretending to be asleep. Yeah. Japan is not the pretty magical place that you think it is.

6926201719902801157~1~🦠 Part II to fixing your stinky drain!  #diy #clean #tips #foryou #satisfying~Another daily tip. Now we know how to clean the overflow, see part one. Now it's time to tackle the drain. Let hot water go through the drain for about a minute, and you guessed it, more soap. While that soaks, let's go down on this sink. This is where we'll find the trap. They call it that because there's always water in it, keeping the gases from coming into your house. Loosen up these nuts to remove the trap. Remember to snap a couple pictures so you know how it comes back together. Make sure you wear gloves. It's going to stink. When it comes to reassembly, do not put a pipe wrench. They do not need to be that tight. So you can either clean this or replace it for like a dollar at the hardware store. This nut back here operates the pop-up drain. That needs to be cleaned too. Imagine what that smells like. For this part, I just use paper towel and a dowel, and I push it all the way through until it pops out the bottom. Gross, but it won't stink anymore.

Así que lo primero que vamos a agregar es el arroz y vamos a empezar a molerlo muy bien. El chiste es retirarle toda la tierrita o la piedrita que le sale cuando un molcajete es nuevo, por eso se tiene que curar. Vamos a empezar a molerlo muy muy bien hasta que el arroz se nos haga un polvo, así. Y vamos a empezar a retirarlo con una escobetilla y le vamos a retirar muy bien y le vamos a agregar la sal. Sí, sí, ya copiando la nueva técnica porque me dijeron que con esa me iba a ser famosa. Vamos a empezar a molerlo muy bien la sal. Asegúrense de hacerlo hasta la parte de hasta arriba y tallele, tallele porque con esa hasta maso va a ser. Más que chulada de molcajete me compré. Con este le voy a hacer una salsa. Tiramos muy bien con una escobetilla y agregamos una cabeza de ajos. Machuquele, machuquele muy bien. Si les gustó mi escobetilla, el link está en mi perfil como Evergreen. Asegúrense de hacerlo muy bien hasta en la parte de arriba. Tiene que quedar así. Agregamos agua y cepillamos muy bien. Vamos a repetir este paso como unas 5 veces hasta que el agua le salga bien bien limpia. Y listo. Así que díganme qué receta les gustaría que les hagan este molcajete. Y que si les gustó denle like, ¿no? Váyanse por allá.

Now what if there's no opening here? This one really bugged me and I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out. I think I figured it out. The first step is roll the window all the way down. You use this to pull it all the way out. You're gonna open your door. You're gonna go over right here all the way to this side right here. You're gonna keep it shut. Now you got this. I'm gonna repeat it on the same side. Now once you set up the other side, I use two carabiners. One goes in here. Now you got a little bit of slack to get it in and then you're gonna readjust it right here. You're gonna open your door a little bit. Close the window and you're all set. No one's gonna come into your car.

As a relationship therapist, I've literally spent my career studying the art of attraction and human psychology, so I know that these things work. The first thing you're gonna do is take advantage of the reciprocal liking concept. When you see them in person, you are gonna act so genuinely excited. Oh my God, I'm so excited to see you and catch up on all the things we talked about last time. You're probably thinking, but Kimberly, like, shouldn't I be playing it cool? Like, shouldn't I be waiting for them to come and talk to me? And the answer is absolutely not. You're gonna treat them like you have a very special connection, and this is because our brains are psychologically primed to like people more when we know that they like us and think we're a good person. This isn't even a flirty thing at all. This is literally that they feel safe and seen with you, and they know that you see the absolute best in them. Next thing you're gonna do, in your conversation, you are gonna point out something that is similar about both of you. Oh my gosh, I can't believe we both have a sister. Wow. The human brain does unconsciously choose people who we view as similar to us. Next thing, when people, especially men, see bearskin, they get aroused. I hate to admit it, but the sundress phenomenon is a real thing. There is a reason why guys like these so much. Your comfort is key when it comes to dressing in front of anybody, but if you wanna play it psychologically, it will not hurt you to show a little bit of bearskin. Finally, this is the kicker. If you are not in a relationship, you're going to make sure that you give other guys the time of day. This brings out a protective instinct in guys, and is usually the exact moment that they decide to lock it down.

7027594258328603909~1~this strategy is a guaranteed A!! LET’S BOOST THOSE GRADES!😁 #textbook #studytok #tips #hacks~This is how straight A students read a book or a textbook. First of all, obviously they highlight the important definitions, ideas, and themes of the text. They circle words that they do not know. They write a one-word summary in the margin after reading each paragraph. After reading a chapter and taking notes, they write a summary of each chapter that they've read on a separate piece of paper or their computer. And when it's time to study for the exam on the book or the textbook, they read each summary that they've written to refresh their memory. If you do this, I guarantee that you will get an A.

It's soft, kinda has the shape of a pill, but it's harder than the Jell-O. And then I did real pills. Started with the soft gels, and the rest came easy.

7234893840107195675~1~Trucos que usaba para eliminar granos (siendo una locuela de 16 años🤓) #humor #trucos #tips #eliminar #granos #acne #beauty #beautytips #fypシ ~Me ha salido un grano. Míralo, aquí está. Y he pensado, oye, y si os enseño a mi comunidad de TikTok cómo hacía yo con 16 años para eliminar los granos, que ojo, las técnicas que os voy a enseñar creo que son horribles para la piel, pero a mí me iba bien y para sacarte un apuro, pues está bien, pero es muy malo hablarla aquí. Técnica número 1. Pongamos que tienes un evento muy importante dentro de poco, más o menos una semana. También un evento importante con 16 años y a salir de fiesta. En este caso, lo que yo hacía, como yo aún tenía tiempo a eliminar ese grano, cogía un algodón y lo empapaba con alcohol. 96%, esto no se debe. Esto lo empapas y cada noche le daba al grano toques. Truco número 2. Pongamos que ahora el evento importante es dentro de 2-3 días. Uy, queda poco tiempo. El truco del alcohol ya no vale. Lo que vamos a usar ahora es pasta de dientes. Marca da igual, ¿vale? Yo es que compro la más barata porque es que no hay dinero, chicos. Por la noche, tiene que ser por la noche. O si estáis en casa mucho rato también vale. Cogeis una pizquita, me he pasado, y lo ponéis encima del grano. Cuando os levantéis o después de un rato, el grano ya estará seco y pues será mucho más fácil eliminar. Ya me entiendes. Mira, con los dos últimos trucos ya está como sequito, ¿eh? Ahora vamos a ponernos en el peor de los casos. El evento es al día siguiente o en horas. Este truco muy poca gente lo sabe, pero si es un grano localizado que os molesta muchísimo, canelita en rama. Y no es ni más ni menos que un ajo. Tú coges un diente de ajo, lo cortas por la mitad y con la parte de dentro como es tan ácida, empiezas a restregarlo hasta que el grano, os lo juro, se despega y se cae. Like si queréis que lo haga y lo ponga a prueba en un vídeo. Os vais a quedar locos.

I always go the extra mile by writing a handwritten note. I include my business card so they can call me when they decide to sell. I keep my picture nice and big so they know who's sending it and I don't seem like a stranger. I go to lick the envelope and remember we're in a pandemic. Not to worry because we've got the T-Wax. Then I pick a wax seal. Nah, too romantic. Nah, too Christmassy. Perfect. B for Brendan. I use this one because it looks really nice and also it sends the message that this is a personalized note just for me. Inside the note, I always make sure to explain exactly how I'm going to help them sell their house, why I'm the best person for the job, and what I bring to the table. I'm using dark blue because that's the Coldwell Banker color. And don't worry, 99% of people don't use the color meanings exactly, so it's fine that I'm using this color. I make sure to center the stamp. Finally, I hit it with the gold and wait for the sellers to give me a call. Like and follow for more.

Like nasty, no self-awareness, in your face, rude. Did you know that there are some psychological ways to put a rude person in their place and make them wish they'd never spoken to you? As a therapist with a doctoral degree in psychology, I've spent my life studying human behavior and I know that if you do these three things, you're gonna have this rude person walking away with their tail between their legs. The most satisfying thing in the world. First thing you're gonna do, have you ever been in a situation where you're going about your day, everything's going amazing, and all of a sudden, somebody is rude to you out of the blue? They are rude to you for no reason at all and all of a sudden, your body starts to escalate. Your palms get sweaty, your heart starts racing, your pupils dilate. Most people are gonna feel that physical reaction and behave by either running away or getting angry themselves and wanting to fight back. But you're not gonna do that. You are gonna take a deep breath. You're not gonna say anything. This makes them feel deeply unsettled and puts them off their game right off the bat. Next thing you're gonna do. Now, this one's a little bit hard, but if you do it right, this person is going to be so embarrassed that they mess with you. Have you guys seen that clip of Tom Cruise on the internet where he's on the red carpet and this guy squirts water in his face? It's really, really rude and horrendous. If you've seen it, you know that Tom Cruise actually reacts in the most shocking way. He starts asking the person questions. Dude, why'd you do that, man? Hey, is everything okay? I'm giving you a nice interview. Why would you squirt water in my face? Asking questions calls out the behavior and brings attention to how ridiculous it is, making them look stupid. At this point of the interaction, they will feel shame. Finally, guys, this is the kicker. You are gonna remember that when someone is consistently rude, they are almost always looking for a dopamine hit. When they unload on you, it actually feels really good for them, especially if they see you physically deflate. If you turn your body away and keep your palms open, it actually asserts your true dominance and deprives them of the dopamine hit they want, so they get zero satisfaction.

Fui a donde siempre hay cosas tiradas y encontré esta goma vieja, me la llevé. También encontré este disco y lo llevé. Empecé a cortar todo el borde para que quede más grande. Ahí le metí el piso y fui a buscar una goma espuma y la corté en muchos pedazos para que quede más cómodo. Así iba quedando por ahora. Y fui a buscar una tela vieja y la empecé a poner en todos los bordes para que no se salga. Y ahí cuando fui, mi perla la había sacado de la cuna. Empecé a pintarla toda blanca los bordes porque no me convencía cómo quedaba de negro. La pinté toda por fuera. Después agarré la gotita y empecé a pegar una cinta para que quede decorativo. La agarré con los dedos y no se pegaba, entonces puse todos broches para que no se salga. Y así había quedado. Después fui a buscar la gata y estaba durmiendo en los ladrillos, pobrecita. Ahí la puse y le empecé a hacer unos mimitos para que se quede y se quedó ahí tirada como una chancha.

There are some really specific psychological and biological things that someone is gonna do when they like you that they don't even know that they're doing. As a relationship therapist with a doctoral degree in psychology, I've spent my life studying human behavior. So I know that these things are true. First thing you're gonna look for is eye tag. This is when you look over at them, catch them looking at you, and then they promptly look away. This is fully biological. They are looking at you because they can't help it. They like you and then they look away because they're embarrassed. Number two, this one's kind of gross, but you're gonna watch really closely for if they start, like, touching their face. When we get aroused as humans, we want to start touching our face. Our face becomes extra sensitive. So if you notice them touching their face a lot or even, like, sucking a straw a lot, they probably like you. You might also notice them touching their upper leg and hip. This is another sign that they're turned on because it's their body's way of subconsciously drawing your attention downwards. I'm serious. It's true. You're gonna pay super close attention to the direction of their feet. If they like you, their feet are gonna be pointed directly towards you. And if they don't like you, their feet are subconsciously gonna be pointing away from you. Number five is exclusion. If they like you, they're gonna try to exclude you and them from the rest of the group. Not in, like, a weird or creepy way. This is just because they want one-on-one time so that they can actually bond with you. They ever try to bring the conversation to, like, a sexy or romantic place. It's often because they're trying to find out if you like them. They want to talk about sexy things so that you will confess. If they talk about working out or what they did in the gym, they want you to notice their body. Number eight is called peacocking. This is when they boast a lot or just come across as really conceited. If this person likes you, they're probably gonna be a little bit of a peacock. But don't worry, it's totally natural and instant because they want to impress you. Finally, guys, this is the kicker. If they give you a long hug, it's over. If you're still not sure if they like you, take my levels of attraction quiz.
7078727970403224837~1~i wish I knew this sooner! #aupair #nanny #annecy #france #europe #hostfamily #kids #tipsforkids #tips~I'm about to show you that if you give a kid a choice, they will always most likely 99% of the time Do what you want them to do. Did you poop? Yeah No, can I check yeah Yes, you did. Can we go change your diaper? Settle me. I think it's time to change your diaper. Do you want to walk or do you want me to carry you upstairs? You want to walk okay, let's go If you literally give a kid a choice They will do what you want them to do. So in this case if I just say let's go change your diaper They're not gonna want to do it They say no But if I say do you want to walk upstairs or do you want me to carry you? Then she has to choose one of them But I end up getting her up the stairs and in the bathroom to change the diaper and the same goes like if you're getting Ready to leave if you have to bring your kids up for nap time. Just give them a choice For example, you can say it's time to go Do you want to put your coat on first or your shoes and then they have to choose one? But they're that much closer to getting ready So if you just say it's time to leave you're gonna like no, I don't want to go 99% of the time if you give them a choice You get them to do what you want them to do. Enjoy

7004427997189065990~1~#handyfacts #adulting101 #shower #tips~Young people often don't know how to take a shower. This makes sense when I thought about it because you're you're bathed as a baby. And then you get older and you're kind of bathing yourself with supervision, but people are telling you what to do. Then you get old enough where you're bathing without supervision and then you probably transitioned into a shower right from that stage with no supervision. So nobody's ever told you how to take a shower. So there's all these little shower tips that nobody's told anybody. And so, well, I'm telling you, so pay attention. One, you don't have a towel. You forgot your towel. Somebody took your towel, whatever it is, a t shirt. A t shirt works fine as a towel. You probably wore a dirty t shirt in and you've got a clean t shirt you're gonna wear. Use the dirty t shirt. No. It's not so stinky that that stink will transfer back onto you. It doesn't work that way. You'll be fine. Two, after you're done your shower, you're dripping wet. Don't just grab the towel and start absorbing all that water. Just use your hands and do a quick wipe down. You'll get, like, seventy percent of the water off your body and your hair, kinda like that. And you'll you'll get your towel less wet, which means you can use your towel more often won't promote mildew as much. There's all sorts of good things. Or if you're using a t shirt, it'll be better tip. Three, when you are washing your hair, the water, like imagine the the shower is coming down. You want it the the the the top, the crest the top part of the water should be landing against your skull, like, right there where the the two points are kind of in the back, and then the water will slow down perfectly down the back over here, and I won't get in your face. And then when you lather up, you can just tilt your head back to your hair wet and add lagged water, take water away, rinse it all off, and it won't get in your face, and it won't go blind from soap. Four, If you have a lot of facial hair or if you have parts of your body with a lot of body hair, it is possible that hair will require a different treatment. Than the hair on your head. This is an embarrassing pay attention to it because you may need specific shampoos for down under or facial hair or anything like that, and they make things like that. So pay attention. Five, if you're getting like kind of, like, little scabs on your scalp and you might be embarrassed by it. Like, what the heck is that? They don't bleed or anything. They just feel like scabs when you peel them off, they just come off and they're just There, that's dandruff. Okay? They always talk about the flakes with dandruff. They don't talk about that symptom in the commercials because I guess it's too gross. But that standard it just means you have dandruff. And honestly, ninety percent of people can be cured of dandruff using a basic dandruff shampoo. You don't have to buy the expensive stuff. Just try like, head and shoulders are the generic rate of head and shoulders, and it'll probably fix it for you. Do I have anything else? No. I think the oh, yeah. The soap. Get the soap. Give it a quick rinse beforehand because, you know, the person before you, you don't know what they were washing with that So so just I mean, two seconds of rinsing, but don't put it right on your body.

If you ever need to remember something, try thinking about it while doing something weird. This will pair the memory with the weird thing. Like if you need to remember facts for a test, eat something strange while studying. Or if you need to remember to take the garbage out in the morning, put the garbage bag in the kitchen sink. You'll remember. If someone's ever trying to make you make a decision in a hurry, it's more than likely a bad deal and you should walk away. If you ask someone a question immediately before playing rock, paper, scissors, they're more than likely going to choose scissors, so you should play rock. Alternatively, if somebody ever asks you a question right before playing, they're going to choose rock, so you should choose paper.

Well I've finely worked it out, cut them into little squares, soak them in some egg, get a hot pan and add some butter. Now let's fry off these babies in hot butter until they're golden brown. This takes a couple of minutes. Now when you've got them golden brown add some sugar then fry these off again for about two to three minutes. So after a total of about five minutes you've got these crispy bread friggin things. Awesome! Give them a crack you won't regret it. Beauty!

This student was only allowed to have a one-page cheat sheet, so they wrote a full page of notes in blue pen and another page of notes in red pen. They then brought 3D glasses to class so that when they looked through the red side, they could see the blue pen, and when they looked through the blue side, they could see the red pen. A class of students were required to pick a Marvel character and then write a resume and cover letter pretending to be them. A student thought of the perfect idea and picked Groot. And since all Groot says is, I am Groot, that's what he put for everything. A girl's dad went to Vegas for the weekend and put a camera in the living room to make sure she didn't have any parties. But the girl wasn't going to let that stop her, so she came up with this genius solution.

6899888226656357634~1~With great power comes great responsibility ;) #advice #tips #lifeadvice #psychology #lifetips #socialhacks #lifehacks #lifehack~Alright, here's how to never run out of things to say. Before I can explain, you need to understand this thing that's inside your head, and you don't even realize it. It's a phenomenon called the spotlight effect. It's a cognitive bias. So real quick, pretend that this is you. Because that's you, and you're human, then you have limitations. One of them is a phenomenon called the spotlight effect. See, because you're the center of your own world, you believe that you're being perceived more than you actually are. For example, say you're driving and you hit a red light. Then you probably think that everyone around you is staring right at you, but the truth is they're not. In your head, you think that you're being looked at way more than you actually are. Ffff- In a conversation, when you're talking to people and you slip up, you probably think, oh my god, everyone's looking at me, everyone's- no, no they're not. It's in your head, like you're not being- you're not as important as you think you are. To never run out of things to say, there's two secrets. The first one is family. Bring up family. It's been scientifically proven that when you talk about family, it builds a stronger rapport between the person. Don't force it, it can come across as aggressive, like, hey, how many brothers do you have? Like, no, don't do that. Make it natural. Something like, oh, I really like your shirt, that's something my sister would wear. Do you have any sisters? See, that's more natural. So I need more times to follow, so part two shows up on your For You page. Bye!

6914060207886847237~1~tips for Zoom classes coming soon:) #fyp #gay #attention #highschool #tips~Hi guys, this is my guide to high school for attention whores, like me. My first tip, you've already heard it a thousand times, confidence. If you don't have confidence, fake it, hold your head up high and walk a little bit faster, that'll gain respect, give you attention, and you're hot, act like it. My second tip is to always leave the school dances early. If you don't have another place to go, go home, it doesn't matter, but people will wonder where you're going, and that'll gain you attention. My third tip is wear pink, wear tweed, wear feathers, wear fur, wear plaid, and wear tracksuits. Channel that Paris Hilton energy because you are the main character, and you're hotter than everyone else, or at least act like it. My fourth tip is to be fun, but be friendly, you can go crazy at parties, I don't care what you do, but be nice to everyone so that if you accidentally throw up on their rug, they won't hate you forever. Also, you want to be the talk of the town, but not the talk of the town in a bad way like Hitler. Sometimes you want to start a little drama, come to school with mascara running down your face, look like you just got broken up with, or just had a crazy night out. People will talk about you.

7008940782682000646~1~What your fingernails say about your health #foryou #fingernails #finger #nails #tips~What your fingernails say about your health. Let's go. Round bulb nails, also known as clubbing nails, means you might have a chronic lung condition or disease. Okay, I wish I hadn't eaten breakfast. Pitting nails, like someone's taking a big ice pick to them, means you might have psoriasis or eczema. Okay, this is a try not to cringe challenge, and if it is, I already failed. This thing right here called bozo lines means you have really bad malnutrition, so you better watch out for that. If you get a dark area under your fingernail, it might not mean anything. It might mean that, you know, you just hurt yourself badly or whatever, or it also means you could have had trauma in your life, or it could also be a sign of sebungal melanoma, which you might want to watch out for. Coilinolial, or yellow nails, or really hard yellow nails, means that, you know, you got a bad skin cancer. Nails that look like this means you have a bad infection, also known as oncomicos. I'll put it up there. Absinthonilia, or half-moon nails, means you've got anemia. And finally, white spots on nails like that means you've had bad trauma or some zinc deficiency. And there you have it. Like and follow for more.

Now this is what I like to call city herbalism because all of these are right by an abandoned, burnt down apartment building. This is called Oxalis stricta, also known as common yellow wood sorrel or lemon clover or sour grass. So you can actually, hold on here. The whole plant is edible. You can actually just take it and chew on it and it kind of tastes like lemon. It's like a little bit sour. It is a diuretic and known to help with digestion. You just don't want to eat a whole bunch of it because the chemical compound in there that can basically mess with your calcium absorption. But it's a wonderful little treat if you want to cut some up and top them on a salad or just chew on the stems.

6940328052530449670~1~Thoughts from the ER #seizure #fake #liar #lies #medical #hospital #emergency #tips #room #blink~Tips from the ER. Fake seizures. Ah, yes. Usually a patient's last ditch effort to keep themselves in the ER. Likely because we just told them we are done with their treatment and now they get to go to jail. That's when they drop to the ground and flop like a fish. Get off the floor, Richard. The officers are waiting. But some of you won't even put in that effort. You'll just go limp. That's when we take your hand, put it over your head, and drop it. If it smacks you in the face, all right, we believe you. You're unconscious. But most of the time, your hand will magically fall to the side and avoid your face. That's when we know you's a liar, motherfucker. With real seizures, you won't care what starts hitting you. To prevent injuries from real seizures in the ER, we have what's called seizure pads that we strap onto the side rails to keep you from breaking your face or bruising your shins. Every ER I've worked at, we can never find the seizure pads when we need them. So we end up wrapping the rails with blankets and taping it together. It's quite ghetto, but it gets the job done.

7014982355588893957~1~#stitch with @.luka.p Hopefully googles new CameraX Api can fix this issue and make it easier for developers  #android #tips #foryou #fyp #samsung~So why do Android phones look so bad on social media? Well, it's a simple answer, and that is that third-party apps cannot support the thousands and thousands of different phones that come out on Android every single year. Because each phone that comes out on Android or has been out for a long time always has a different processor, a different camera, just different settings altogether. And these app developers don't have the time nor money to develop these apps that work great with every single phone. So they create a generic one that works across all Android devices, and it's terrible. All it is is actually just screen recording the viewfinder in your camera app. That's why you see such big frame drops and just overall bad video quality when compared to your native camera app. Is there a way to fix this? No, you just have to record it in your native camera app instead of a third-party app. And this has been an issue on Android phones since Android's been a thing.

Did you finish? Jeez, man. It's pertinent, Harlan. We need to know. Did you ejaculate? I did, yes. I'm gonna write an order. You need to go to the lab. What happened? You had another allergic reaction. Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm the problem, honey. It's me. What are you talking about? We ran tests on Harlan's semen, and it turns out you're allergic to it. What? No. It was never an issue before because you used condoms, which you stopped once you started trying to get pregnant. His semen? Come on. Oh, my God. So what are you saying? We can't have sex anymore? Yeah, what about kids? There are options. We'll get you to a fertility specialist. There are multiple procedures you can do. We'll also set you up with an allergist. There might be some methods to help you build up a tolerance. With treatment, your sensitivity may lessen. Meanwhile, you can go back to having sex with condoms. Hey, you two obviously love one another. You'll work this out. Just keep an epic pen on your necks, too. You know, walking in on them like that got me thinking. Ever since we started IVF, I feel like the only time you touch me is when you're injecting me with hormones. You're right. How about we have a date tonight and stay home? I'd like that.
7252018469321903402~1~Replying to @hosedude   A journey to the Surface of Last Scattering! Looking out in space is looking back in time. How far can we look? #astronomytok #spacetok #physicstok #astronomy ~So this is a picture of the beginning of the universe. It's a picture of shortly after the beginning. Yeah. That's ridiculous. What do you mean? Dude, listen to yourself. How can we have a picture of something that happened so long ago. But what did someone travel through time to take this? Basically. Yeah. Oh my god. Dude, I'm afford it for you. No need to be, man. Look, just hear me out on this. Light moves at a speed, the speed of light. Right? Yeah. So the farther away something is from you, the longer it must take for its light to reach you. Right? Yeah. If you think about it then, you're never really seeing anything as it is right now, but as it was in the past because light takes time to get places. Now, light is insanely fast. It could circle the earth seven times in one second. So for all and purposes everything close by is as it is right now. But lights travel time becomes increasingly significant again, the further and further out you look. Okay. So for instance, it takes light about one second to get from the moon to the Earth. So when we look at the moon, we are seeing it as it was one second ago. The sun's light takes about eight minutes to reach us. So we see the sun as it was eight minutes ago. Wow. We see the nearest star to the sun as it was four years ago. And the nearest major galaxy to ours as it was two and a half million years ago. I can't even process that. We're just warming up, dude. With modern telescopes, we've now observed a plethora of galaxies so distant that we see them as they were billions of years ago. That is a significant fraction of the entire age of the universe ago. And something interesting happens when we observe of especially distant objects like that. We noticed that the further out we look, the simpler everything becomes, simpler clear? Yeah. It's a clear trend that progressively distant galaxies are on the whole not as massive and less developed than those that are closer by. Okay. And that's exactly what you'd expect because by looking out that far we are looking at earlier moments in cosmic history. When the universe and all of its contents were younger and less evolved. Time machines exist, dude. They're called telescopes. And when we use them, we become time travelers. Watching the history of the universe unfold right before our eyes. That is amazing. It's the coolest thing ever. We can look so far out into space and back in time that we eventually reach a point where stars and galaxies didn't even exist yet. We can look at a time when the universe was so young that it lacked any kind of structure at all. We have a picture of that time. It's that one. That is the universe as it was about four hundred thousand years after it began. Long before the formation of any celestial object, specifically a photo of what we call the surface of last scattering, and it is the farthest thing that we can ever possibly see. What? Why?
7250173236409814298~1~Find out if she likes you  #manipulation #psychology #crush  #makima #m0ziy ~If you have a crush on someone and want to find out if she like you too, use this simple psychological trick. The next time you talk to her, take a step closer for no apparent reason. There are three possible reactions. If she stays in the same place without moving, she likes you. If she also comes closer to you, she is very interested in you. However, if she gets nervous and takes a step back, it shows that she doesn't like you. This trick works because we humans unconsciously tend to want to be near those we like.

A businessman asks his night watchman to wake him up at 7 a.m. the next day because he has a plane to catch. The next morning, the night watchman wakes up his boss at the requested time but tells him not to leave because he dreamt that night that the plane was going to crash. Price of doubt, the businessman decides to cancel his flight and learns from the news that the plane has indeed crashed. The businessman thanks his night watchman for saving his life but tells him he's going to be fired. So, why do you think the night watchman was fired when he had just saved his boss's life? I'll give you a clue at the end of this TikTok but first, give me your answer in a comment and I'll pin the one who found it first and above all, don't hesitate to subscribe. I'm posting a new riddle every day. The clue is as follows. In this riddle, the night watchman had better do his job right.
7243841004757863726~1~The oldest light in existence comes from the edge of the visible universe. The Cosmic Microwave Background radiation! 🤯🌌 #astronomytok #spacetok #physicstok #astronomy ~Dude, what is the farthest thing that we can see in space? That would be this. What is that? Oh, it's just a baby picture of the universe, the CMBR. CMBR? Yeah, man. The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It's the very first light that was ever released into the universe. See, this image is a projection of the entire sky, showcasing the most ancient light in existence, which is coming from all directions at all times from the very edge of the visible universe. What? The light you're seeing here was emitted when the universe as we know it was just a few hundred thousand years old, meaning that this light began its journey to us before the Earth had even formed. Heck, before the Milky Way galaxy had even formed. It then traveled through space for over 13.5 billion years, losing energy as it did so due to the expansion of the universe, which slowly stretched it into low-energy microwave light by the time that it finally landed on our telescopes. Now, the place from which all of this cosmic radiation was released is formally called the surface of last scattering. And not only is it the farthest thing in space that we've ever seen, it's the farthest thing that we can ever see. It's the edge of the visible universe. Dude, stop. I am so lost. So what am I looking at exactly? You're looking at the moment that the hot early universe transitioned from an opaque plasma to a transparent gas. You're looking at the light that was trapped within that primordial plasma and set free at that moment. You're looking at the afterglow of the Big Bang. Explain! Well, we've got a lot to go over.

In nineteen thirty eight, there was this new drug invented in Germany. It was called permitten. Okay. Now, permitten. All permitten was was a methamphetamine. Okay? They didn't understand. It was brand new. People didn't understand. That there were long term effects from taking shit like this. Right? So at first, they're doing the tests. These scientists have taken the purposing. And next thing, you know, their fucking work output increases by two hundred and fifty percent. They're capable of staying awake for three fucking days at a time. Just crack it out numbers. So the German the the German government decides, alright, this is incredible. This could work in the home front. So what we're gonna do is put the perfect in into chocolate. Right? And we're gonna send it out into the fucking grocery stores. Try to try to advertise it to German housewives. Right? But you take some of this chocolate. Right in the morning. Right? Instead of coffee, you're gonna take some meth chocolate. Right? It's gonna get y'all picked up and then you clean the house at fucking mock ten. Right? So it started to get really popular in Germany. Right? And then evil mustache man, along with his generals, find out that some of his soldiers had actually been taking fervent before they invaded Poland. Just some of them on their own volition. Right? So the German military gets this fucking idea. They say, what if we make Perveton, a mandatory part of the German soldiers rations. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna take the purposing. We're gonna put it into chocolate, and we're gonna we're gonna give it to them. Right? And now the tank cruise, they came up with a new nickname for this with this meth chocolate. They call it pens or chocolates. Panzor chocolate. Tank chocolate. Because you would take this shit. And the next thing you know, you'd be fucking geek. There were other names for it too. They would call it the Stukka pill. You know, the Stukka the plane they would go. So they called it the stukapil. Right? So you gotta understand. The German military orders thirty five million fucking doses of Perpeton. Right? As they prepare to invade the countries of the west. And in nineteen thirty nine, as the German Army's lining up on the fucking border, I'm talking fucking hundreds of thousands of troops. They are all given the order. Take out their canned teams. Take out their permits. Put a parvath and capsule on their tongue and swallow it and then wait. And as these soldiers waited on the fucking border, you could feel the heart rates of hundreds of thousands of men, slowly increasing. As they got ready for this blitzcreek. This accidental lightning spade. It was it was completely accidental. So and and don't get me wrong. Other thing that people don't understand is that he almost dashed me in and was loaded up on this shit, taking all sorts of different drugs every day, including you could go and heroin.
7255453221509123374~1~The First Black Saint #history #edutok #learnontiktok #religion #blackhistory #christian #saint #ancienthistory #funfacts #jesus #blackhistorymonth #saintmoses ~When the first black saint was attacked by a group of robbers while praying in a monastery, he tied four of them together, dragged them into the main hall, and forced them to become monks themselves. When the enormous man of immense physical strength was just a child, he was enslaved by a local official in Egypt. But suspected of theft, he was thrown out of the house and left to fend for himself in the streets. Turning to a life of crime, he fell in with a notorious band of thieves, and proving exceptionally useful in a fight, was quickly made the leader of the 75 men. When he once went to rob a house in the middle of the night, he swam across the crocodile-infested waters of the Nile River while holding a sword in between his teeth. But when the homeowner's dog alerted the man to his presence, he was hunted down by the local authorities, and forced to hide in a monastery to escape. When the monks found him, he was so impressed by their kindness they became a brother himself, and it's said that so sudden a conversion from vice to virtue was never before witnessed. Walking 20 miles a day while fasting in the hot sun to bring water to his elderly brethren, he became known as one of the Desert Fathers, some of the most important figures in the early church. And it's said that his dedication to defeating demons was so great, he would even sleep standing up without closing his eyes. Rising to lead dozens of men, he told his followers, You fast, but Satan does not eat. You labor tirelessly, but Satan never sleeps. The only dimension in which you can outperform Satan is humility, for Satan has none. When he turned 75, a second group of robbers advanced upon his monastery, this time in unbeatable numbers. But ordering the other monks to flee, he stayed behind, saying he wished to fulfill the Lord's teaching that those who live by the sword shall perish by it. When you're the mightiest monk to go from mayhem to martyr, they don't just call you the first black saint. They call you Saint Moses the Ethiopian.

7252504452525985051~1~I find new opportunities every day scrolling tiktok. Too bad my plates full so take my ideas to the moon #business #entrepreneurship #onlinebusiness #businessideas ~The Million Dollar Wi-Fi Business Ideas for Lazy People Part 1. I came across this video on TikTok of Theo Von trying smelling salts. Me being curious George, I decided to look up smelling salts on TikTok. To my surprise, hundreds of viral videos of people reacting to smelling salts popped up. And after making millions of dollars online, one thing that I know is where attention goes, money goes. Especially, this is a very easy video concept to copy over and over again. And it sells. Next, I went to Google and I typed in smelling salts private label. This is how I find suppliers that will ship the product directly to the customer every single time I get an order. And most of the time, they even put your logo on the packaging. Contacted the first supplier I found and they said they'll drop ship this for $8 a unit. Perfect, we'll sell it for $30. Now if you're really fucking lazy, go to this AI website called Wizard and it'll create you a website in seconds. Or if you're just a little lazy, go to Shopify. In my opinion, it's a lot better, you'll end up making more per visitor. Now here's where the millions are made. Now to get to your first $100,000, which is very easy with this business model, follow this exact strategy that I'm about to show you. Step one, go to TikTok and search up smelling salts. Now sort by most liked, download every single video that you can find that has over 100,000 views. To do this, use snap tick. Now upload all these videos up onto YouTube shorts. Remember to credit in the caption, the owner of these videos, just so you don't get hit with a copyright. Now paste the link of your new website that's been created by AI or Shopify with AI in the comments and pin it to the top. I've done the same exact thing on TikTok a handful of times, even hitting my first $100,000 in the first week. So yes, this should work. But we're not done yet. If you want to see the strategy that will take you from $100,000 to a million dollars in sales, there's a link in my bio, click that and I'll send over the strategy.

7256524408238525739~1~#stitch with @Cameron #animals #fyp #foryou #funny #viral ~I'm sorry, what the fuck did you just say? I said that pigs could theoretically be used to cover up a murder It's weird seeing my own video on my for you page Anyway, since I have a bunch of new followers, I'm gonna go over the most morbid of facts that I know So a female dragonfly will fake its death when it doesn't want to have sex But that wouldn't stop a penguin, because penguins actually fuck dead bodies And that also applies to a lot of other species like otters and especially dolphins If a duck gets bored enough, it will just resort to eating another duck That's almost as bad as dolphins, who just beat the shit out of babies And physically and psychologically torture animals when they're bored Polar bears are actually one of the most dangerous species of bear Because they don't just kill humans out of defense or when they feel threatened No, they kill humans because they want to eat you Polar bears are actually some of the most stealthy animals on the planet in their natural habitat Like if you saw a polar bear, it's very likely that it's been tracking you for a few days A polar bear will walk up to you the same as a dog would if it just wanted you to pet it It will not show any hostility whatsoever and just start taking bites out of you Like if you were to grab an apple off the counter And if you started screaming, its demeanor would not change Moose have very poor eyesight So if you were to park your car in front of a forest with a moose population It's possible that the moose will try to fuck your car or you If a mother penguin loses its baby to either death or just actually losing it like in a supermarket It will steal another penguin's baby It's like, nah, that's my child now That's almost as fucked up as when a dolphin kills another fish to use it as a fleshlight Ducks have a corkscrew penis Crocodiles can climb trees Someone found a court record for a literal dolphin going on trial
7244281057489603882~1~Chocolate chip cookie - ze best one #chocolatechipcookies #cookies #desserts #chocolate #baking #recipereview ~We tested fifty chocolate chip cookie recipes, and this is the best one. If you introduce yourself as someone who makes the best chocolate chip cookie, you immediately appear to be more trustworthy. Let's learn this recipe together. The number one secret to a perfect chocolate chip cookie is to brown your butter. It adds that nutty rich depth of flavor that you would find in your local big So when I finally decided to make this recipe, I realized the recipe is in their bio. When I clicked on the bio, I realized the recipe is in a separate link. When I click on that link, it took me to a whole separate gallery of recipes that I have to scroll down so far to find the cookie recipe. And when I click into the cookie recipe, I have to watch as and read through the author's entire life story to get to the ingredients. I hate when people do stuff like that. So to make it easy for all of you, I have listed the ingredients on my Instagram link in bio. Our first step is to brown a whole block of butter. You have to be careful though because it might explode like this. And once it's so foamy, you can't tell if it's brown or not. It's probably time to take it out. You lose of the water during the potting process, so we recommend adding a few tablespoons back in. I'm gonna put some ice cubes in it because ice in hot oil sounds pretty fun. For a chewy soft texture, we recommend using a mixture of red and all purpose flour. So one and three quarters of a cup of a p flour. Whenever the recipe requires a mixture of flour, I just use all purpose. It's called all purpose for a reason, along with the teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda. We also like adding in a teaspoon of espresso powder to enhance the chocolate flavor. So in a separate bowl, we'll go with a cup of brown sugar. Half a cup of white sugar. I love espresso powder, so I'm adding a little extra. And the best picky dough consistency uses one egg yolk mixed with one regular egg. The dessert MSG, one egg, one egg yolk, leg a fork until smooth, add in the butter. You can beat this on the couch if you want, but I'll just do it here. Combining the dry ingredients with the wet mixture. Combine the dry ingredients and wet ingredients in a satisfying way. You just keep of chopped chocolate in addition to smaller chips to create the perfect wells of gooey goodness. And I also know that you like the chocolate snapping sound. I'm gonna eat what you want. After we fold the chocolate into the dough, we roll them into perfect looking balls. So most of it away in the freezer and then bake four of them. Three fifty, four fourteen minutes. The large size of the chocolate chunks kinda makes it look like a mess made by a baby, but I'm sure by the end, it will be more satisfying as well. Let's do what it did in the beginning and split open multiple cookies at once. Yeah. A bite out of these will max out my dopamine level. Let's give it a taste in raid o n thirteen. I think I nailed this one. Crunchy on the outside, chewy and gooey on the inside. The only issue is that it doesn't look that good. So nine point five out of ten. But again, I've never had a chocolate chip cookie that didn't taste good. I've also never had a chocolate chip cookie that didn't have a glass of milk to go with it. Even though it's expired for a few days, but it tastes fine. Alright. Thank you.

So let's say you both are on a date and it's not going well. There's one thing you can do to spice things up a bit. When you notice her getting bored, grab your phone and check it for about half a minute, as if you're reading something with a serious expression on your face. Afterward, quickly stand up with a worried, concerned expression and tone and tell her, I'm sorry, I'll be right back. And boom! What seemed like a boring date suddenly becomes a spike of anxiety. Now she's going to wonder what happened. Did someone get hurt? Is someone coming for you? Am I in danger? What should I do? And you know what's the best part? After a minute or so, you come back with a drink or snack, looking calm and happy and say, here you go. Confused, she might ask, is everything all right? Then you calmly look into her eyes and say, now it's 10 billion times better. And the stage is set. She now has a deeper emotional connection with you because you made her feel anxious for a moment and then relieved that anxiety. Additionally, you made her feel that she was useful to you by making you feel better about her being there. Three rabbits with one stone. She won't be forgetting this date for some time. If you agree with me and have watched the video so far, drop a 100 in the comments. And until we see each other next time, peace.
7242222266669485313~1~How to go VIRAL doing YouTube Automation… #youtubeautomation #youtube #sidehustle #viral ~Isn't it insane that this channel got over 2 million views on their very first upload? The crazy thing is that they didn't achieve this by chance. They follow a structure that works every time. The algorithm doesn't give a shit about subscribers or followers. Watchtime is the most important statistic you have when it comes to how you edit your video. This is where the leading question structure comes into play. The leading question structure isn't something most content creators want you to know about, but why should you trust me? Well, I run over 300 channels and have built an entire company around running channels with this exact structure, so trust me when I say that I know exactly how the algorithm works. Let's have a look at this channel, JumpShot. Their first upload has accumulated over 2 million views in just 8 months. This particular video starts with a crazy statement that makes people have a leading question and makes them want to keep watching the video because they need to know the answer. The creator wants the viewer to always have a question in their mind that gets answered very quickly. However, that answer has to then provide the viewer with another question to ponder, creating a chain of questions that keeps them watching the video. The watchtime will skyrocket and we all know YouTube loves that. This is only one part of the content creation process though, alongside the triangle of content creation which I uncovered in my last video. If you want more details, leave a comment and I'll make another video with all the answers you seek.
7246623536570273030~1~6 Manipulative hacks that most people don’t know.☠️👥#manipulation #advice #foryoupageofficiall #fyp #foryoupage #trending ~6 manipulative hacks that 95% of people learn too late. 1. Confusing people is always the best strategy. If someone insults you, pause for a second and look at them and say, Are you okay? Works every time. 2. If you think someone is lying, look at their eyes and don't say anything. 3. If you're in an argument, keep your voice calm. It'll give them the impression that you're winning the argument. 4. Good posture increases confidence. Spread your body out and take up more space. It'll lead to increased confidence. 5. Open with, I need your help. People don't like the guilt of not helping someone out. When asking for a favor from someone, begin your request by saying, I need your help. It greatly increases your chances of getting that favor done. 6. If you want someone to agree with you, nod while you talk. This gets the other person to nod too, and they begin to subconsciously think they agree with you. These are some of the manipulative hacks that most people don't know until it's too late. They can help you confuse, persuade, or dominate others, but they can also backfire or be immoral. Use them sparingly and responsibly.

So you want to type this in right here. Then the first one that pop up, you want to click this one. You're welcome. Okay, this is the fun part. Let's really get into this. So now, social engineering is involved. What is social engineering? Ask your mom. In simple terms, it's basically manipulating people to gain authorized access. Unauthorized access, I'm sorry. It's like tricking or deceiving someone to reveal sensitive information. Like your local scammer. So if they know the victim is obsessed with women, this is how they use it to their advantage. So they will find an image. So in my case, I'm going to use Kim Kardashian. So now I'm going to copy the image address. I am a woman. Alright, you want to take that bad boy and then you want to paste it here. Then hit create URL. Of course, accept this. So what you want to do is enable this. And here's your tracking code. So every time you want to revisit to see if anybody clicked it, you can come here. Okay, so now what we're going to do is change the domain and make this a custom link. So you come over here, click this. Alright, so let's look for domain. Let's look for something with pictures. Alright, boom, pictures. We select the extension. Image. Then boom. Hit copy. And then you can send it to the person, but I will make part two.
7252469091301182725~1~Exposing the smartest people on tik tok part 2 🦍 @Einstein.ai  ~exposing the smartest people on TikTok and how much money they really make, part two. Today we got Einstein AI. They've only posted two times and they have 4.8 million views and they've made $9,090. I know because I run this account. But this is what's actually crazy. And if you were smart, I would save this for later and do it yourself. But this content that I generated for Einstein AI that went viral was completely AI generated. The captions, the AI voice, the images that show up at the top, they're either generated by an AI or pixels. The background is automatically randomized between Minecraft backgrounds and GTA 5 backgrounds. All of these processes completely automated running at the same time. I can make hundreds of these videos faster than you could probably edit one. First, you find an account that makes talkative videos. I'm gonna go with AI Sentry. Just copy his username. Keep in mind, this isn't available to anyone yet, but all you're gonna do is paste that at right here and click get free clips. And this downloads all the most relevant videos on that person's account. And most importantly, the scripts from the video. We then use the chatTBT API to rephrase the scripts so they're slightly different and we're not copying. They get put onto the script to video page and you can go in and edit them, place your own call to actions, whatever you want before you generate them and turn them into videos. For now, we've only tried it in the AI niche. We can eventually take videos from like medicine gurus as well as drop shippers and then promote drop shipping courses. It's kind of endless and that's why we really haven't dropped the tool yet to public because we wanna do it ourselves and try and make as much money possible ourselves before we release it to everyone else. But we do have an early access sign up on clipium.ai where you can try and be one of the first ones to use Clipium.

7238139565129616648~1~jadeblairxox&#x27;s short video with ♬ original sound~So, I'm a kind of worker and something that makes me so sad, my clients, they have to text me to make a booking and part of my screening process is they have to send me a face photo. And a lot of them freak out because they're like, oh my God, like what if you don't like what I look like or if I'm too old or I'm ugly or I'm too hairy or overweight or, you know, these are the things that they say. And I say, you know, don't worry about it at all. First of all, the photo has nothing to do with your looks. It's purely for my safety. It's kind of a way of many ways that I implement to identify a client. So if something happens, I can go to the police and say, well, this is who you're after. It's not the only way I do it, but it's one of many. The other thing is like, I'm not doing this booking for my own personal satisfaction. I'm there to work. And so like any worker, I want to do a good job, right? Like I have integrity. I want to be good at what I do. So I'm really focusing on my client's pleasure, not my own. So it really doesn't matter to me what someone looks like as long as they're, you know, hygienic. So it really breaks my heart when clients get really, you know, upset or really shy about how they look and get kind of caught up in their head. That's like the last thing that you need to worry about. I'm going to get so much more pleasure out of you, the client telling me, you know, that you're enjoying it or, you know, what I can do better, how I can make it a better experience than, you know, just having some eye candy. Maybe I just have a braised cake. Maybe that's what I'm trying to say here. Don't look good. Just tell me I'm a good girl, please. Thanks.
7238690673254354203~1~Let’s see how this one goes #makingmoney #sidehustle #sidehustles #cash #onlinebusiness #ecommerce #money ~Alright Kaden, really hope this one's gonna make me millions because the last one was pure trash. Testing TikTok side hustles so you don't have to part 32. Everyone says you can make easy money with a claw machine business. Let's try it. I found someone on Facebook marketplace selling two claw machines with locations for 16. Out of all of you watching this video, how many of you got 1600 bucks to spend on some claw machines? Not me. So I met up with her and bought them both. Then I went online and spent $150 on stuffed animals. Not gonna load the machine. I gotta pack it tight so the kids can't win anything. That is so harsh and sneaky and and genius. You can change the strength of the claw to make it even harder for people to win anything. Come on, Kaden, at least give them a chance, bro. Just don't make it impossible to win and nobody will ever play it. Come back in 30 days. See how much money we make. Back 30 days later, let's see how much money we made. So the first machine has no toys missing, but there's a good amount. So not a single person has won anything. Really? A lot of money in here. There's no toys missing from the second machine either. And there's some money in here. The first one has a decent amount of quarters. The second one also has a few. I'll probably never have to refill these machines again. So they'll probably profit. I'll be honest, it sounds like quite a bit of hassle and a lot of money up front. Not great, but it's still better than the trash picking from the Riverside hustle you suggested last week. About $100 a month. Some locations will let you keep your machines there for free because it's good for the customers, but others will want 20% of all your profit. And if the machine ever breaks, you'll have to Slowly these side hustles are better and better. Can't wait to see what he comes up with next week.
7246524266496134443~1~For those who want to know! Have fun, be safe! ~So do you want to know how to get this? This is the scammer's IP address and this is my master's degree in Homeland Security and you do not need this to get that. Say you get an email from the government. They spell the state department wrong. It's already pretty suspicious but are they really going to give me the million dollars they've offered? Well, let's find out. I'd recommend using an IP logger like Grabify. You're going to put in a link to wherever you want to send them. Normally I do it with the Google Drive so they can see something they want to see and then hit create URL. Now once you put your link in it's going to generate a new URL. That's the one you're going to send to the potential scammer. Also turn on smart logger and if you want to customize this you can use that button over there and once they click on it it's going to give you all their information including where they're from which is super weird that as a United States citizen I'd have to pay taxes to the United Kingdom. I thought we had a revolution about that. With smart logger on it's supposed to detect if a VPN is being used. However, sometimes it misses it like in this case and you have to put it together yourself. For instance, it's claiming to be from the United Kingdom but the time zone of the computer is Shanghai. Something's wrong. Now I didn't give them access to the Google Drive page that I was using so they said something's wrong. Can you help us? I was like oh yeah it normally doesn't work with VPNs. Try turning yours off and so now they're actually from Hong Kong. Also if you're talking to a scammer do not download anything they send you and if you're suspicious about a link try putting it through one of these. So with that simple trick you can help keep you and your loved ones safe. If you do find a scammer mess with them. Wasting their time is fantastic because it prevents them from going on to other people. If you want to mess with them in like more detail it would require one of these and I recommend either homeland security or cyber security also a virtual machine. So yeah be safe out there.

Since the beginning of time, mankind has always asked questions about our reality. Why are we here? What is our purpose in life? And why is there something rather than nothing? But the most ask question of all is does god exist? When we look at our universe, we have no choice but to ask why? Why does the universe exist? Could have been by chance. Could the universe just happen without an explanation and simply could have been a coincidence nothing more? Let me put it into perspective for you. The boss ability of the universe being born by chance is so infinitesimally small that it's equivalent to throwing a single atom anywhere in the entire universe at random and pointing it out a million times in a row. Just think about those odds. The percentage is so small that it's literally regarded as zero, a zero percent chance that is what it truly is. Because how can something come from nothing. There must be an explanation, Ryan. Every single thing in the universe from people, animals, and than nonliving things or contingent, or more simply they depend on another existence that explains their own. Contingent basic means subject to change or could have been another way. But let's make this easier for you to understand. Here's the premise. For anything that begins to exist, It's dependent on another existence that caused it to exist. For example, people depend on water to exist because if water did not exist, People wouldn't exist. Water depends on water molecules are simply h two o, two hydrogens and one oxygen. If oxygen and hydrogen did not exist, There would be no water. Water molecules depend on atoms to exist and so on and so forth for even planets and stars that depend on their own compounded makeup. And this is observed for everything in the universe. Just sit and think for a second. Is there anything that begins to exist that depends on nothing. Moving all the way out, we can even conclude the universe itself had a beginning. But how do we know? Why can't the universe just be eternal. Think of it like this. If the universe is eternal, we would have an infinite past behind us, meaning there's an infinite series of events that took place before the present, but that makes no sense because we would never reach the present from an infinite past. An example of what I mean would be numbers. If they're an infinite amount of numbers between zero and one, would you ever reach one. No, because infinity entails that there is no beginning and no end. The same logic applies here. If there are an infinite amount of events between the past and the present, would we ever reach the present? Note, so if the universe began to exist and we know that all things that begin to exist have a cause. What caused the universe to exist? The thing that caused the universe to exist be independent and not contingent on anything. Because if it was, it would just be another link in the chain of dependent things that needs another to explain it. And this can't go on forever because just like the numbers example of how we would never reach two, we would never reach existence. But we have reached existence, meaning there must have been a start. This reality is the start. The very first thing. It is the cause of the universe's existence and thus is outside of space and time, meaning it's eternal because it's not bounded by the flow of time, non physical because it's not bounded by space and is the cause of their existence. This lady is necessary and cannot fail to exist in any possible world because it's the start of dependent things. The only independent existence. Now here's where it gets crazy and truly listen to these next words because this is why I will never be an atheist. This independent necessary reality that everything depends on to exist could have simply just been. It needs absolutely nothing to exist and nothing caused it to exist. It could have simply just been by itself as the only thing in existence but that leads me back to the first question. Why are we here? If this single reality needs absolutely nothing to exist, and could have simply just been the only independent thing in existence. Why is their dependency? Why do we exist? The answer. It made a decision. This independent reality made a decision to cause everything that exists and is the sustainer of all of things, which means this reality is able to make decisions and is therefore intelligent and is a source of our intelligence in consciousness, and it's all powerful because it did not just bring a grain of sand into existence, it created everything this reality goes by many names and you can call it whatever you want, but what it is that you're describing is God.
7251908669732949275~1~In this series i will show you my journey on how to make 10k a month using AI within a year #ai #aimoney #artificialintelligence #aitools #aicommunity ~Episode 1, how to make 10K a month using AI within a year. Let's start with creating content for your social media pages. I'll show you how I make mine. Go to YouTube and look for any background videos. I'll take GTA 5 as example. Download the video URL and head over to Snapsave. Paste the link and download the video. Now go to Google and search for content. Simply type in artificial intelligence, go to recent news, and choose any topic you want to make a video about. Once you have picked your article, give it a quick scan and head over to ChatGPT. Ask it to make a summary about the article and watch ChatGPT generate you an accurate summary. Copy the text and paste it into a Google Docs document where you will carefully read the summary and look for the main sentences. Once you have identified the main sentences, you will now write a script for your video based on these sentences. Or if you are lazy, use ChatGPT. Moving forward, head over to Eleven Labs, paste your script, and generate your audio file. Now open CapCut and start a new project. First, add your video and scale it. Next, add your audio, go to text and transcribe it. Once your subtitles are generated, choose a font and add an animation. Your video template is now ready. To make it more engaging, go to a website like Freepik and look for images or videos related to your topic. Now watch the final result.
7242134494097050886~1~I love @garyvee BUT… No need to run around town and hit up every garage sale/thrift store. Comment: MENTOR below ⬇️ i’ll send you my FREE training 🥳 #airbnb #airbnbbusiness #sidehustlesecret #passiveincomeforbeginners #airbnbhost ~I think anybody making under $100,000 a year that is deeply unhappy should quit and garage sale 52 weeks a year. Goodwill, garage sales, eBay, easy 100,000. I love you, Gary, but I'm not doing garage sales. I've got a better way of potentially making money. Let me ask you a question. Did you know that Airbnb has paid its host 180 billion since 2008? Do you want to claim your share of the 180 billion Airbnb pie? Let me give you a hint. You don't need to run around town hitting every thrift store like a goofball. Let me show you how. Step number one, go to Craigslist for your local market and click on the housing category. Step number two, click on this button to see the oldest listings for rent. Step number three, find a property that's been sitting for 20 days or longer because that means that the landlord is losing money and needs your help. Step number four, copy the address, paste it into the Airbnb Analyzer app, and click this big blue button. The Airbnb Analyzer app shows that this property could potentially make $160,000 a year on Airbnb, which is almost triple the long-term rental rate. From this, the landlord gets his $54,000 rent and the spread is split 50-50 between you and the landlord, which means that you could potentially earn $53,000 a year in recurring income from just one Airbnb listing. Do this a few more times and you can potentially have a six-figure income stream.

7241310034230054187~1~Follow my dad @      For teaching me how to do this ~Some more shit that your father should have taught you if you had one. I'm gonna show you how to change a tire on your car. Start by locating this tool somewhere in your trunk, and your car should have came with one when you bought it. Or if you could somehow get your hands in a professional one. I highly suggest that it'll make your life a million times easier. Either way, these are both called and say it with me now. A jack. Not to be confused with your best friend, that's a jackass. What a jack does is lift the car off the ground. Before you start jacking the car off, you wanna grab the bar that comes with the jack because this is what you're gonna use to loosen your lug nuts. The reason you wanna loosen the lug nuts while the car is still on the ground is because while it's in the air, if you try to turn the lug nuts, the wheel will either start spinning or the car will push forward and fall off the jack and break a bunch of shit. If the lug nut is stuck like the shit won't come off, simple. Fucking boot this shit out of you. It might break them, but you really only need like three out of the five. And, yes, I do have the dad love song. I'm trying to get into character. Tires all loosened up. You're gonna wanna take this piece of the jack, and you're gonna wanna line it up with this little metal lip that's underneath every single one of your car. Strid. You start cranking it up. Your tire should be roughly eight to nine inches off the floor as you can see here. At this point, you wanna start removing all the lug nuts that you loosened up earlier. You wanna leave them on so that the tire didn't just fall off while you're cranking it up, but you can take them off pretty much whenever. Why are you even removing your tire Looks like it's fine because you see this metal that's sticking out of my tire? Yeah. You're never supposed to let it get like this, but I am a professional fucking piece of shit. So I ride things out until they fucking get destroyed as you can see. This is probably the biggest pain in the ass of the entire process is putting the spare on because you have to line up all five or six of the little fucking shit. At this point, you're just gonna wanna hand the screw all of your lug nuts just to get them in place. Just a rule of thumb whenever screwing in lug nuts. You always wanna screw in the one that's directly across from the previous one that you screwed in. It's just the best and safest way to make sure that they're all screwed in tight enough. Once they're all nice and tight, you can start uncramping the jack and lowering the car back up and use the little bar tool to really tighten the fuck out of all the lug nuts. Still going to the one directly across from the previous one. You want them to be as tight as your little human arms will allow. And now, you have successfully changed your tire. I need a fucking blush. Hit
7256494190434143534~1~#stitch with @Kaylin Mally  IMPORTANT:  if youve NEVER taken bee pollen before, start with only a few granules for like a week or so before increasing dose! i started out with only 1-2 granules for the first day to test for a reaction. then i increased slowly but surely. - dont make the mistake of consuming too much at first, you may have an allergic reaction. Build your bodys tolerance to bee pollen  - i mix it into smoothies, yogurt bowls,  or overnight oats, but the options are endless - i found mine at a farmers market, but you can find at whole foods, sprouts, online  - bee pollen can help stregthen your immune system (which is why i was initially drawn to it!), anti inflammatory, increases energy levels, and works as an antioxidant  - if u read all of this, comment a 🐝 u a real one ~Bee pollen makes your girls grow bigger. Bro, the way I just ran to make this video right now, because I've been taking bee pollen for months now and I can testify that it does make your girl bigger. For real, I've been eating this almost like every day. I just put a spoonful on top of my yogurt, on top of smoothies, overnight oats. I really just put it on everything. And I had originally bought it because my immune system sucks and I always get sick. And I heard that it's like anti-inflammatory, helps boost your immune system, gives you more energy. So I've been taking it for that reason, but turns out I've been making my girls grow as well. So anyways, if anyone wanted a testimony, here it is, get your bee pollen. I got mine from a farmer's market, but I guess you can get it at any like Whole Foods or like health grocery store. But I will say when you start out, don't start off with a spoonful like I did. Like this is way too much for your first dose. Start off with like, honestly, like a couple pebbles because your body may get like an allergic reaction to it. Too much bee pollen at once, you have to work up your tolerance. But anyways, yes, it does work.

7255506081550601518~1~Never Pay Off Your House~You have a house. And let's just assume for a moment that what you owe on it is $200,000. You bought it several years ago. During this last pandemic, what happened? The price is shot through the roof. So, let's just assume for a moment that the current value on your property is $400,000. It's worth 400 but it's half paid off because you only owe $200,000. Did you know that you can go to the bank and you could request something called a home equity line of credit? A HELOC. And basically say, bank, I would like a credit card that is attached to the available equity in the house. And the bank says, well, we'll go up to 80% of the value. 80% of the value of $400,000 is $320,000. And the difference between $320,000, the max the bank would allow you but what you owe $200,000. Basically, the bank says, here's $120,000. If you don't use it, it's available. It's kind of like a credit card tied to the equity in your home. So, you get this home equity line of credit and you're like, what if I went and I bought another house? Let's just say I bought a rental. That rental cost me $50,000 out of pocket. Now, where am I getting this $50,000 down payment? I'm getting it from a $120,000 line of credit that the bank set up for free for me. Now, here's where arbitrage comes in. I can borrow this 50% let's say at 3%. But I can put it into a property where I'm earning a 25% ROI. And a part of that is cash flow. And let's assume for just a moment that cash flow is $450 a month. I'm borrowing the money at 3 and I'm earning a total return of 25%. Remember, you get to keep what's in the middle which is 22%. And on top of that, giving you $450 a month of positive extra cash flow in your life producing a tax benefit where that $450 has no tax consequence because it's written off against the depreciation. And on top of that, there's leftover tax benefit that will reduce my normal job income so that I give less back to the government.
7234680024031317291~1~The Craziest Inventor in History #history #edutok #learnontiktok #ancientgreece #ancienthistory #inventor #philosophy #math #funfacts #quotes #science #archimedes ~When the craziest inventor in history built a giant claw to lift ships out of the water, he destroyed the Roman navy besieging his city. When the Romans returned and constructed so many catapults, they thought they were being attacked by the hundred-handed giants of mythology. When asked about the force-multiplying power of leverage, he said, Give me a long enough lever and a place to stand, and I'll move the whole world. When no one believed him, he used a system of pulleys to pull a fully-laden ship ashore, using only his two hands. When he was working on a problem, he'd often forget to eat, sleep, and drink, and had to be forced to bathe by his students. But when he overflowed his bath and realized you could measure the volume of any shape by the amount of water it displaced, he jumped out of the tub without putting on any clothes, and ran all through the city, shouting Eureka! When the king of Syracuse wanted a ship, he built him the largest one made for the next thousand years, capable of carrying two thousand people, and complete with a garden, a gym, and a temple to Aphrodite. And he built all this in his spare time, preferring to study mathematics, where he discovered pi and came within inches of inventing calculus. When the Romans continued to attack, he allegedly built a heat ray from thousands of shields, and aiming it at their sails, burst entire ships into flame. But when they finally snuck in and captured the city, the Roman soldiers found him scribbling his geometry in the sand. As the soldiers approached, he ignored them, and when they tried to get the high-value prisoner to come peacefully, he simply said, Flying into a fit of rage, one of the soldiers pulled out his sword and dispatched him. When your inner life is so fascinating you forget to worry about your outer one, they don't just call you the craziest inventor, they call you Archimedes.
7250849626763398446~1~So a couple countries are casually creating a world power and meanwhile, in the USA, our leader has no clue whats going on. - - - - - #TuckerCarlson #TuckerTakes #CarlsonCommentary #TuckerTalks #CarlsonClips #TuckerTikTok~The country with more ships than any Navy in the world has united with the country that has more nuclear-armed ICBMs than any country in the world to fight us through proxy in Ukraine. Well, that's scary. And the thing is, everybody involved seems to know it's scary and just how scary it is. Our leaders understand that their push for total war with Putin, which is unnecessary, could lead to the destruction of the West. They know that, but they're doing it anyway. In an interview with a German newspaper today, Ukrainian President Zelensky casually mentioned that, oh, by the way, the entire world may soon go up in flames. Quote, if China aligns itself with Russia, there will be a world war. There will be a world war? If China aligns with Russia? Who could say something like that calmly? Since, as we just told you, China is aligned with Russia. It's already happened. That's not speculation. It's a fact. And as a result of that fact, according to Zelensky himself, hundreds of millions of people will die. No big deal, as long as we take Crimea. This is a very dark way of thinking. Zelensky himself is a very dark force. That is obvious if you watch him. It is unmistakable. Who could not see that? This man is a destroyer. He banned a Christian faith in his country and arrested nuns and priests. Oh, but he's a hero, claim our readers from Chuck Schumer to Mitch McConnell. No, Zelensky is not a hero. He is an instrument of total destruction. That is not a defense of his enemies. It's just true. And maybe that's why Joe Biden is drawn to him.
7255295486549167403~1~The Battle of Marathon #history #historytok #historytime ~Here's a quick f**kistry lesson. The year is 490 BC and we're in a little town called Marathon. Not famous for anything yet. Just chilling, minding its own business. You could say it's a bit like that quiet kid in the back of your high school class that never said much. Little did we know it was about to become famous AF. So here's the setup. You got the Persians, right? Big empire, lots of soldiers, gold out the wazoo. Think high school football team meets billionaires. They're the cool kids on the block, flexing their military muscle all over the place. They're led by this dude named Darius Watt. Not Darius II or III, no, this is the OG Darius. Meanwhile, you got the Athenians, underdogs of the century, a ragtag group of citizen soldiers. These guys are grossly outnumbered, like a chess club at a rock concert. But they've got this badass general, Miltiades, who's like, nah, we ain't backing down. We're Athenians, baby. We've got brains and brawn. Now here's the crazy part. Miltiades hatches a plan to fight the Persians on the beaches of Marathon. He's going for that whole surprise, b***h kind of vibe. He forms his army into a formation that's thicker on the sides and thin in the middle. It's all looking a bit suspect, like when your friend says they've got a great plan after six beers. The Persians see this and they're like, what the f*** is this? Christmas came early, boys. And they charge right into that trap. The Athenians on the flanks curl around and it's a full-on, no-holds-barred Persian sandwich. The Persians are getting wrecked left, right and center. It's an upset that'd make any sports commentator lose their mind. Meanwhile, back in Athens, they're sweating bullets, right? They have no idea how the battle's going. So this runner, Pheidippides, volunteers to run all the way back to Athens to bring news. The dude sprints 26.2 miles without stopping, busts into the assembly and gasps out, Rejoice, we conquer, before keeling over dead from exhaustion. And that, my friends, is how the Athenians kicked Persian a**, how the town of Marathon got famous, and how a guy running himself to death became the inspiration for the Marathon race. Ancient history, man, you can't make this s*** up.

7252364624106933547~1~#history #historytok #historytime ~Let's rewind to Japan in the 1600s. Musashi was the OG sword-swinging, philosophy-spewing, painting-and-sculpture-making badass of the time. But let's get to the real sh**, the duels. This dude fought 61 of them and didn't lose a single one. Musashi wasn't like your normal samurai. This dude was a maverick. He didn't just use one sword like those regular samurais, oh no. This badass was all about the Naiten Ichiryu style. Two swords, one in each hand. He's dicing up fools left and right, making grown-ass men cry for their mommies. But there's one duel, one f*****g duel that is the stuff of legends. The big one, Musashi vs. Sasaki Kojiro. Kojiro was a badass in his own right, known as the Demon of the Western Provinces, and wielded a goddamn washing pole of a sword. This was the heavyweight title fight of samurai showdowns. So, they agree to meet on this island at sunrise for the duel. But here's where Musashi pulls a sneaky on him. Instead of showing up at sunrise, he takes his sweet-ass time. He arrives late, keeping Kojiro waiting. Already pissed, Kojiro sees Musashi rock up in a boat, using his oar as a makeshift sword. Kojiro is livid. He thinks Musashi is taking the piss. He pulls out his sword, that big-ass washing pole, and attacks. But Musashi, the absolute legend with a f*****g wooden oar, blocks his strike and counters. One hit to the head and Kojiro's down, he's out, he's f*****g done. Musashi just beat the Demon of the Western Provinces with a boat oar. No mystical sword, no secret technique, just pure, unadulterated skill. He hops back on his boat, sails away, leaving everyone dumbfounded. And that's why this dude is a legend. Sixty-one duels, zero losses, and the biggest f*****g you in samurai history. That's Miyamoto f*****g Musashi for you. King of the samurais, and an absolute unit.

She ain't just bickering about chores or why she can't go out with the village bad boy. Nah, this girl is talking about getting messages from God and s***. She's like, yo, God's on the line. He's saying we gotta kick the English out of France and apparently I'm the girl to do it. Everyone's like, the hell you talking about, Joan? But she don't care. She gets all decked out, full armor and all, looking like a medieval Iron Man, but less shiny. Then she convinces the prince, Charles VII, and she's like, yo, Charlie, I got God's direct line here and he says you're the man. So you gotta stop hiding in the bushes and take your rightful place as king and I'mma help you do it. And Charlie's like, alright, if you say so, but let's try this s*** out first. Now, this English army has been whooping French a** for some time in this 100 years war thing. And Joan's like, alright, watch this. She pulls up to Orléans, where the English have been bossing around. She gets on a horse, armor shining, banner flying, and charges in. The English are like, what the f***? Is that a teenage girl charging at us? Damn, the French must have really run out of soldiers. But then she starts winning. She's like, move over, you English tea lovers, this is French territory. She turns the tide and France starts to get its groove back. She escorts Charlie to his coronation and everyone's cheering. She's become like the medieval Beyoncé, except instead of killer vocals, she's got a killer instinct on the battlefield. But then, the English capture her, right? They put her on trial for heresy and witchcraft. The English were like, you're a witch! And Joan's like, nah, homie, I just got better Wi-Fi connection with God. They don't listen, burn her at the stake. They were probably hoping to cut the holy Wi-Fi, but damn, were they wrong. Cause that s*** backfired, made Joan a martyr, a saint even. You just can't keep a good woman down. Meanwhile, all these centuries later, we're still talking about her. That peasant girl who talked to God, whooped some English a** and strutted around in full armor. Now that's a legend. I mean, what were you doing when you were a teenager? Cause I sure as hell wasn't leading armies. Comment down below what you want to f***ing learn next.

If they are telling the truth, they will be confused why you think they are lying, and they will say something like, or do you think I'm lying? However, if they are lying, they will be scared that you may have found out that they are lying. This will make them tell you more details to the story to make it sound more believable. But just know that if they do this, they are lying. Don't follow me if you want to be manipulated.
7252038179174534446~1~History Facts That Will Make You Go What The F—- #history #historytok #historytime ~History facts that will make you go, what the actual f**k? Numero uno, Australia once declared war on birds and lost. Yeah, you heard me right, the Great Emu War it's called. So back in 1932, Australia's facing an emu invasion. Over 20,000 of these giant flightless birds are wrecking crops all over Western Australia. So what does the government do? They say, f**k it, let's bring in the military. So the army rolls in with machine guns and they're shooting these birds down like some bird-brained war zone. But here's the kicker, despite all the firepower, those crafty emus outsmart and outrun the soldiers. After six weeks, Australia waves the white flag. The emus, those feathery bastards, they f**king won. Australia, land of kangaroos and koalas, gets its a** kicked by a bunch of birds. Moving on to crazy fact number two, you know Pope Gregory IX, right? Well, in the 13th century, this dude declares that black cats are an instrument of Satan. Yeah, those cute furry critters that knock s**t off tables for no reason. Pope Gregory's all like, nah, those are satanic beasts. And he orders a mass extermination of black cats. Now you might be like, okay, so what? Well, this dumb move ended up contributing to the spread of the Black Death, aka the plague. How? Those black cats, they were the prime hunters of rats. And those rats were carrying the fleas that spread the plague. Less cats, more rats, more plague. Nice going, Greg. All right, let's cap it off with fact number three, The Dancing Plague of 1518. This one's f**king bizarre. So in Strasbourg, a city now in modern-day France, people just started dancing out of nowhere. It starts with one woman, then more and more join in like some freaky non-stop flash mob. But it wasn't a happy dance party. People danced till they collapsed from exhaustion. Some even danced themselves to death. Nobody knows why. Doctors, priests, politicians, nobody had a clue. To this day, it remains one of history's weirdest mysteries.

7254053793334152490~1~Sound of Freedom #history #historytok #historytime ~I got a story to tell you, one that's been part of human history since we learned how to grow crops and wage wars. I'm talking about slavery meat. Now, this ain't a story of pretty little pastries. It's some real deep dark shit, and it's been going on since the dawn of time. You think slavery started with the pyramids? Nami, it was way before that. Back when we were just starting to make shit out of bronze, the big strong tribes would conquer the little ones. And instead of killing everyone, they just say, hey, you work for us now forever. Fucking savory right there in a nutshell. Jumped forward a couple of thousand years to the Roman empire. You got slaves everywhere building roads, fighting in the arena, and even teaching the rich folks bratty kids. A whole economy built on the backs of people who didn't have a say in their own damn lives. Then you get to the transatlantic slave trade, Africans were ripped from their homes, chained up and shipped off to the Americas to work the plantations. I mean, the entire economy of the south was built on this shit. It was so integral that they even had a civil war over it. Now, you'd think with all our modern sensibilities in so called progress, this would be over and done with. Right? Wrong. Right now, there are more slaves than in any time in history. Fifty million people are currently enslaved. Slavery is still a thing made. Only now it's all hushush. Behind closed doors, hidden in the shadows. Human trafficking, child soldiers, forced labor, sex slaves. It's a one hundred billion dollar industry growing like a cancer, and the world turns a blind eye. But here's the thing. There are people out there fighting the good fight pulling these victims out of the shadows and giving them a voice. This ain't just some bedtime story mate. There's a real life superhero out there, Tim Ballard, who said, that to a cushy government job to start operation underground railroad and fight these sick to trade in human misery. And you know what? They made a movie about it. Sound of freedom starring Jim Cavisel. It's not some Hollywood action flick though. It's the raw heartbreaking truth of what's happening in our world today. It shows the brutality of the traffickers and the courage of the rescuers. It'll make you sick. It'll make you cry. But it'll also make you angry. So here's what you need to do. Watch the movie. Learn about this. Because ignorance ain't bliss, it's cowardice. And then do something. Speak up. Just go watch this damn movie so we can tell these criminals that we're done with their sick practices. Whatever you can do to help, because this real, it's happening right now. And it's up to us to put a stop to it. Remember, mate, the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing. So do something because the world might be nuts but that doesn't mean we gotta sit back and accept it. We have a chance to take a stand and change history.

7246977946907446574~1~Im surprised this submarine didn’t go missing sooner #submarine #oceangate ~So this submarine that they still can't find, do you know the details about this? This man has a company called ocean gate, which already sounds like a scandal. He offers this experience where you take a submarine down to the floor of the ocean so you can see the Titanic. This company has no regulations or standards. You have to sign a waiver saying I'll probably die, but it's fine. Cause I love the Titanic and it costs a quarter million dollars to do it. So the people in the submarine were billionaires. The submarine is the size of a minivan. So all five of them are in this little tube. But what's crazy is that he like Jerry rigged it with like construction tubes and camping supplies. Well, listen to how it's operated. We run the whole thing with this game control, babe. Like no wonder five years ago, someone who worked there was like, I think people are going to die. And they're like, you're fired. It's highly reputable. Marine technology society was like, please don't do this. They have about one day left of oxygen. And there's three things they think could have happened. Could be floating on the surface of the water because they can't open it from the inside. It has to be from the outside. They've been searching and like, this isn't likely. Option two is that there was like a crack in it or something. And it just imploded, which honestly is pretty plausible. And the last is that they are stuck in the Titanic. This is the case. The only way they can be saved is if instruments come down and basically break it apart. But like, do they even want that? Like if I love the Titanic so much that I ignored every sign that I was going to die. Don't rip the Titanic open for me. I don't want the survivor's guilt. Like I came down here with an Xbox controller. I knew what I was doing.
7249812954512624939~1~Parts of the Oceangate Submarine Have Been Retrieved And It’s not looking good #foryoupage #fypシ #oceangate #submersible ~Parts of the imploded submarine have just been revealed on camera, along with some very interesting news. The Navy has been working around the clock for 10 days to retrieve parts of the imploded submarine. The front cover of the submarine was in one piece along with the engine compartment. Most of the parts recovered prove the carbon fiber hull was the fatal blow that ended the passengers on the submarine, and Oceangate is about to seek protection under the limitation of liability. The same thing the owner of Titanic had done before when he got sued for the ship sinking. This would make Oceangate not liable for what happened or limit their liability of the implosion of the submarine, so the family members of the passengers can only get a certain amount of money if they win the lawsuit. The FBI and authorities are going to investigate the parts of the submarine to determine what went wrong, and whether they would proceed with a criminal investigation or not. It's also being confirmed that this was the 7th dive to the Titanic on the Titan submarine, and the mother of the 19-year-old kid on the submarine gave up her spot to her son because of how much he wanted to go on the submarine. And the sounds heard by sonar underwater has been said to be the noise of metal pieces of the imploded submarine hitting each other underwater.

7254267461766237486~1~#history #historytok #historytime ~So it's eighteen twelve and Napoleon's got this massive hard on for power. He's already done the impossible, crowned himself emperor and pretty much ruled Europe like it's his playground. But there's one big ass bear that's been giving him the side eye, Russia, under the rule of czar Alexander the first. Napoleon's like, fuck it. I've taken on the rest of Europe. I can handle a bunch of vodka loving Russians. He gathers the largest army Europe has ever seen. We're talking six hundred thousand troops. This is the Grand Army, his pride and joy filled with soldiers from all over his empire. It's summer, it's hot, but they're keen and ready to take on the world, or so they thought. Now, Russia, they've got this tricky little tactic called the scorched earth policy. It's like when you leave a party but drink all the beer before you go. As Napoleon's forces move in, the Russians retreat. Burning crops, villages, anything that might be useful to the French. Napoleon's voice, they're marching deeper into Russian territory. Toy, but there's nothing to loot or pillage. It's all ashes and dust. And then there's the battle of Boradino. It's the biggest and bloodiest single day action of the Napoleonic Wars. Napoleon does his usual thing being a military Maestro in all, and the Russians, they lose a lot of men. But here's the kicker. They don't surrender. They pull back leaving the battlefield to Napoleon, but they don't lay down their arms in capitulate. Napoleon strolls into Moscow expecting the Russians to wave the white flag, except the city is empty, like ghost town level empty. And what do the Russians do? The Madlad set their own city on fire Napoleon's like well shit. There's no grand surrender, no bargaining, nothing for him in Moscow, but smoking flames. Now, Napoleon's in a pickle. It's getting colder, his men are hungry, and the Russians are still refusing to play ball. He hangs around in Moscow for a month, hoping the Russians will come to their senses. But nah. The Russian winter is setting in, and it's a brutal bitch. This ain't the French snow. This is Russian snow, the kind of cold that'll freeze the balls off a brass monkey. Napoleon for all his genius has to admit this ain't working. He orders a retreat. Now you've got a picture of this. Thousands of men's starving, freezing, trying to march back the way they came. It's chaos, a slow moving disaster. The Russians, they're just picking off the stragglers swooping in like vultures on a carcass. By the time Napoleon's grown army makes it back to friendly territory, they're not so grand anymore. Out of the six hundred thousand who started only about twenty two thousand made it back. It's a disaster, one of the greatest military catastrophes in history. And Napoleon He gets back to France and it's all starting to fall apart. His reputations taken a beating. His enemies are smelling blood in the water. He'll keep fighting for a bit, but the writings on the wall all because he thought he could take on the Russian winter. The moral of the story, don't fucking invade Russia in the winter. Even if you're Napoleon bone apart. But did people learn? Nah. Just ask the Germans. But that, my friend, is a story for another day.

7253145431717301547~1~History Facts That Will Make You Go What The F—— #history #historytok #historytime ~history facts that will make you go, what the actual f*** first off, did you know there was a time when f*** beer flooded the streets of London? Back in 1814, this huge a** vat had a brewery burst, causing a domino effect that took out other vats. The result? A tidal wave of beer, about 1.5 million liters, flooding the streets, wrecking houses, and killing eight people. S*** you not, a beer tsunami. People even tried to loot the beer while others were drowning, like f*** Sally, grab the pint. Madness. Now you've heard of wars starting for all sorts of reasons, right? But did you know there was one that started over a f*** bucket? Yeah man, the War of the Bucket in 1325. These Italian city-states, Modena and Bologna, had been at each other's throats for years. One day, some dudes from Modena stole a bucket from a well in Bologna. That was the last straw. Bologna was like, give back our goddamn bucket, and Modena was like, come and get it. So they f*** went to war, and Modena won. They kept the bucket, and it's still in a museum in Modena to this day. Over a f*** bucket. Lastly, there's this time they elected a f*** corpse in the US. Not even kidding, man. In 1923, this guy named Charles Hatfield, who was running for the Senate in Tennessee, went and kicked the bucket just before the election. But did that stop him? Hell no. Dude won by over 50,000 votes. People thought it was a f*** joke, but legally a dead man won a seat in the Senate. The seat stayed vacant until his wife, who, you know, was actually alive, took it. Talk about a weird flex.

7252174399883857157~1~I’m really playin with fire with this one but lets see what happens #interestingfacts #ancient #history #civilization #hieroglyphs #annunaki #sumerians #fyp~Our ancient past may have come into contact with highly advanced technology and they didn't even try to hide it from us. Take a look at this. Why does almost every ancient civilization have these carvings of people holding handbags or at least something that looks like a handbag, but what are they? And this is definitely not some coincidence. I mean, these handbags are found everywhere. From the ancient Sumerians in Iraq to the Egyptians, Turkey, Italy, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South America, New Zealand, all over the world. One of the most common themes in ancient stone carvings, and we have little explanation for it. Some people say that it's a basket or a bucket of water. I mean, it could be, but like why and still others claiming that it's a symbol of life or passing down of knowledge to the next generation of humans. But even so, what are the chances that every single one of these cultures chose this handheld purse a completely out of context object as their symbol. Conversion evolution is a theory that humans tend to think evolve in a similar manner independent of each other, but using that as an explanation is a bit of a stretch. One thing we know we're certain is this handbag was significant, as was anything that was carved into stone this often. Some the crazier theories even say that this could have been the ancient interpretation of some advanced technology, drawing similarities to the packs that astronauts carry, but given that's also quite a stretch. So is it symbolic of life and knowledge or just an innocent bucket of water? The answer could be hidden deep in these following records, starting in Egypt with this hieroglyph uncovered in the temple of Osiris. Just have a look at these and tell me if you see anything because I don't know maybe I'm the one that's tripping here. But does this not look like a helicopter? Maybe a tank or a boat? An airplane? What looks to be a spaceship? All carbon into stone thousands of years old. Now I already hear the Google debunkers crying. This has been proven wrong that these are just hieroglyphs that were written many times over and shapes are just a combination of many characters. Damn. They didn't know they were there when these were carved given how hundred percent certain they are of it. There are so many other questionable hieroglyphs in ancient Egypt, but I'm gonna have to say those for video. Okay. If you try to sleep tonight, then you might wanna scroll now. Or at least say this video for later because we about to see just how deep this rabbit hole goes. Let's take this all the way back to the cave Mandez with paleolithic cave drawings and carvings also known as petroglyphs. These ancient aboriginal cave paintings in Australia dating back to fifteen thousand five hundred BC known as the Bradshaw paintings. Take a note of their big round heads here. China Lake Naval Air Weapon Center, New Death Valley, California has Petrobras dating sixteen thousand years. Again, tall beings with bubble shaped heads and lines coming out. Oh, look at that. We see similar cave drawings in Ginkgo State Park near Vantage Washington, all in the US of A. To ceiling Najjar is a plateau in Algeria Africa. With these raw paintings dating to about ten thousand BC. Again, with these strange bobblehead creatures almost like they're wearing helmets, some of them even appear to be wearing gloves and full on suits. Now before you say, oh, that's just how they drew humans back then. Well, because right beside them, we have these drawings of completely normal looking beings. So What are these creatures? Other side of the world in Toromuerta Peru, petroglyphs around twelve thousand years old of beings with bubbles around their heads and lines coming out. Across the ocean to Asia, cave paintings in Chattanooga, India dating about eight thousand BC, feature bubble heads with lines coming out over to Europe, the Valca Minica, Pria store rock art in Italy over five thousand years old and you tell me what you see here. A human looking creature holding strange tools wearing a bubble helmet with lines coming out of it. Yeah. Because prehistoric humans around the world just all decided to draw the same thing. Right? Then we start to come out of the Neolithic era to the oldest known civilization. Sumerians whose tablets include this stone carving. We have no clue what this is, but it really do look like some flying object with some force build coming out from need. And this other tablet looks pretty innocent until you notice this. Doesn't that kinda look like a sun shape that just so happens to have nine balls around it? Exactly the amount of planets in your solar system. Guess they count upon Pluto. So did they have advanced knowledge of our planets over four thousand years ago? Back to the Egyptians, we see this dude in some serpent looking craft. Could be part of their mythology, but then we see the exact same thing in the Mallory of New Zealand, in the Aztec and Olmics of Central America. And now the Mayans, oh man, what on earth is dis carving some complex looking contraption complete with hand controls and something up his nose. Not to mention they seem to be wearing helmets again, which sure could be decorative, but on Earth are these contraptions are in? Is this their way of interpreting spaceships, seaside discs allegedly revealed by the Mexican government, are over a thousand years old in hidden until twenty twelve. And I mean, just look at what's going on here. Granted, there's a lot of controversy around these and they do seem a little fishy, but physicists system has seen Haramin gave a full presentation about itself. I don't know. You'd be the judge. This three thousand year old spaceship carding down in modern day Turkey, but of course, debunkers will admit it's anything but that. A silver solid figurine wearing a helmet in gloves found in a Ukrainian village dating back to six hundred BC. Carvings of people wearing helmets and full on suits and gloves at the Hoi Sala Souar temple in India dating back to about nine hundred years old, if not more. Are those base suits? Note that these different from these spaces and statues in Spain, which were actually just part of a restoration project in nineteen ninety two, so don't be fooled. Even as recent as the Renaissance tell me, what on earth are these little creatures flying in spacecraft doing in a Jesus painting from thirteen fifty. Look closely and you'll find similar flying saucers in dozens of these works of art over hundreds of years old. I mean, seriously, this list is endless. The more I looked, the more I found, but it wasn't easy. So if you're interested in tripping like this, that you won't find on Google. I joined the wait list from my upcoming private channel. And the angels you see in religious renaissance paintings have been around a lot longer than you think. Crediting even the bible, depictions of winged beings were very popular among Egyptian hieroglyphs. And we see the same pattern in the carvings of the Sumerians, which are even older. Some of them even going a step further and showing these beings with the head of a bird. Now, why the obsession with birds? Let me finish you off with this thought. If some prim of civilization where to come into contact with something they can't explain with their current understanding of the world. Don't you think they would describe that thing in terms they can't understand? So if they were to witness some sort of being coming down from the sky. The only thing they know that are airborne are birds. So naturally, they would associate that being with a bird, far fetched yet plausible explanation of the popularity behind bird like gods among these ancient cultures, which leads us to their creation myths and you'll listen pretty much every single one of the world's ancient civilizations have the same story of how we came to be. Okay. I know this was a lot, but I just couldn't believe what I found out about these stories, so I have to say this for another video. Hey, I gotta tell you. I might not be around for very long, Jim, the boy
7236521884962262318~1~🎖️🐻 The Bravest Bear in History #history #edutok #learnontiktok #bear #bears #poland #polish #ww2 #funfacts #war #animals #wojtek ~When the bravest bear in history was just a cub, his mother was slain by hunters and the poor orphan was carried off to a train station in Iran. But when he was rescued by Polish soldiers fleeing the Soviet Union, they bottle-fed him back to health with milk and honey. And on cold nights, he even cuddled up next to them in their tents. Imitating the soldiers, he learned how to smoke, drink, and wrestle. And when the men went on patrol, he'd march alongside them on his hind legs. When a spy broke into the Polish camp, he sniffed him out while hiding in the showers. And when the intruder laid eyes on his furry foe, his panicked scream alerted every soldier within miles to his presence. But when the Poles boarded British boats bound for the Italian campaign of World War II, they were presented with a strict policy prohibiting pets on their ships. Yet not willing to leave the brown bear behind, they found a loophole and formally enrolled him into the Polish army as a private. During the famous Battle of Monte Cassino, the Germans had fortified a monastery upon a hill and had devastatingly repulsed three prior attacks. But carrying crates of ammunition that would normally require four strong men, the courageous cub charged up the hill, successfully resupplying the Polish artillery. And even in the face of heavy enemy fire, he never dropped a single crate, allowing Allied forces to capture the stronghold and gaining promotion to corporal for his bravery. After the war ended, the Iron Curtain prevented the Poles from returning home, and so the brave bear was brought to a zoo in Scotland, where he was frequently visited by his fighting friends, who'd often bring him treats and jump into his enclosure for a good wrestle. And it's said that for the rest of his life, he would happily stand up and salute whenever he heard Polish. When you're the most ferocious furry fighting force to ever fight for the free world, they don't just call you the bravest bear. They call you Corporal Wojtek.
7258036033432849707~1~people often say that &quot;the dinosaurs went extinct&quot; 65 million years ago, but that&#x27;s not *entirely* true- some of them survived, and are still here to this day! thanks to their adaptations that allowed them to survive the harsh years that followed the asteroid strike that killed off their dinosaur cousins, maniraptors made it &amp; are still kicking it 🐦  #dinosaurs #paleontology #animalfacts #animaltiktok #animaltok #dinotok ~The dinosaurs are extinct and label them as if we didn't wait what I meant wait what? It's true there are still living breathing Maniraptors to this day. In fact if you look around outside right now you will probably see one. And the reason why they're still here while other dinosaurs aren't is actually pretty fascinating. So Maniraptors were theropod dinosaurs. They walked on two legs and had hollow bones and feathers. When the giant asteroid hit the impact itself dealt incredible damage with an enormous blast radius but it also kicked up such a massive cloud of sediment that the entire planet was dark and cold for years afterwards. Most plants died off leaving behind nothing to eat for the herbivores and herbivores dying off meant less to eat for the carnivores. But the small beaked dinosaurs of the Maniraptor clade were already well adapted to eating seeds rather than vegetation which preserved well and could be scavenged even from the forests that had been destroyed by the blast. This meant that these small adaptable dinosaurs were able to survive the mass extinction and their descendants went on to become the birds that we know today. That's why if you've ever looked at a bird's feet and gone wow that kind of looks like a dinosaur it's because it is. And if birds being dinosaurs surprises you just wait until you find out that we are all technically fish.

What are you hearing at school? What are they telling you on the internet? Well, they're telling you to stop being yourself. Sit still. Stop joking. Suppress your aggression. Share your feelings. Obey. Female qualities are virtuous. Masculine qualities are oppressive. That's the message. In case it wasn't clear enough, schools around the country have removed urinals from boys' bathrooms. The male body itself is shameful. Sit down when you pee like a good little girl. Views like this are often called feminism or woke politics. But in fact, they amount to mass conversion therapy, an attempt to change the fundamental nature of people. Nothing like this has ever been attempted at scale. It's one of the most grotesque and destructive experiments in human history. What would it be like to find yourself the subject of that experiment? As a boy trying to become a man during the Biden years? Well, you might kill yourself. Many have. You might decide to reject your own manhood and embrace androgyny or even switch sexes. Girls are better? Fine, I'll become one. Or more likely, you might simply withdraw into porn and weed and video games and give up on your life before it's begun. You might retire at 19, a less dramatic form of suicide. All around us, this is happening. Noticing it is forbidden, but that does not make it any less real.
7253830939841662251~1~#news #facts #knowledge #science #viral #foryou #learnontiktok #story #facts ~This huge rock in Saudi Arabia is perfectly cut in half, and no one knows why. It's been around for 4,000 years, and scientists still don't know exactly how it was cut in half. Now, some have speculated an ancient civilization carved the rock in half, and others believe it was cut in half by the same aliens who built the pyramids. But the most widely accepted theory is that the rock just naturally settled like this, and broke in half on its own. The Titanic is disappearing at an alarming rate. Scientists are estimating that it will be completely gone within 20 years, and this is due to it being eaten away by bacteria and other marine life. New footage shows the captain's bathtub, a favorite image among Titanic enthusiasts. It's almost completely dissolved at this point. The Titanic currently resides about two miles below the North Atlantic, and while there have been many schemes proposed to raise the Titanic, with its current condition, there's just no way that that could happen without severe damage. Not to mention, letting the ship rest and disappear in peace is probably the more ethical thing to do. In 1946, the U.S. military set off a nuke underwater to see what would happen, and it went very badly. You see, the Navy was trying to prove that their ships could survive a nuclear explosion, so they lowered the bomb 90 feet in the water and put their ships over it. The LSM-60 was right above the bomb, and it was completely pulverized. Other ships sank right away, and the extreme radiation destroyed any remaining ships.
7231405550074891525~1~The type of stuff your 2am fyp was made for #interestingfacts #antarctica #1912 #ancientcivilizations #captainrobertscott #icewall #fyp ~Antarctica is a lot different than you think. Videos like this paint it as a barren yet beautiful land of ice and snow. But apparently there are leaked photos that show us they're trying to cover up something big down there. Back in 1912, Captain Robert Scott led an expedition to the South Pole to map it out and take some pictures. This was 47 years before the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, which heavily restricted tourist travel to the majority of Antarctica. For your own safety, of course. Now, these were the photos released by National Geographic of the expedition. Just some family-friendly fun adventure, right? But apparently, that was just the tip. And if you know me, I do not like just the tip. Story goes, Robert Scott and his team went down there to map the South Pole. And these are the photos they took, which were hidden from the public and apparently recently got leaked. Ancient ruins, statues, and even what looked like pyramids of some long-lost civilization that they don't want anyone to know about. And the crazy part is, in March of 1912, just two months after these photos were taken, Robert and his whole team died on their journey back home due to starvation and extreme cold. And these photos got later recovered by some search party that found them. Now, doubters will tell you these photos are fake because Google told them, but even ancient maps painted Antarctica as green. And this map from 1512 even shows South America connecting to the Antarctic shoreline with incredible accuracy. Antarctica is twice the size of Australia and was thought to be ice-free as recently as 6,000 years ago. And we're supposed to believe ancient humans managed to find their way around every single continent in the world, even discovering the microscopic islands of the Pacific Ocean. And somehow they just fully skipped Antarctica even when it was a luscious green paradise? A lot of people argue these ancient ruins aren't real and who knows, but you gotta keep an open mind, right? But what are confirmed real are these photos of what looks like a pyramid hidden under the snow in Antarctica. There are many photos that prove it exists and even professors admit it. And obviously the Google debunkers will tell you, oh, it's a natural mountain formation formed through erosion, but I don't know what kind of looking-ass mountains are cut this perfect. Even satellite footage confirms it, so I don't know, you think there's something down there or are we the trippy ones?
7239472703155997998~1~the 13 trick #magic #math #maths #cardtrick #illusion #mathematics #selfworking #13 #thanksmom  ~I wanna show you the magic trick that literally changed the direction of my life. My mother showed me this trick a long time ago, but when I asked her what it secret was, she told me, Michael, I don't know, it just happens. And ever since that day, I have loved math and recreational math matics. Here's how you do it. You start with a deck of fifty two cards. It can be anyone's deck shuffled in any way, just pull out a card, turn it over, and look at its value. Eight. Now from eight, count up to thirteen just like this. Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. Alright. Turn it over. Now we're gonna do this as many times as we can. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. Next up, we've got a jack. A jack is worth eleven. Twelve thirteen, turn it over. Moving on, nine, ten, eleven, twelve thirteen. Now we've got a four, five, six. Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, turn it over. We've got ourselves a king. A king is already worth thirteen. That pile is done. We're gonna move on to six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. Now we've got a queen. That's where twelve thirteen were done. Moving on, nine. Ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen. Do we have enough for one more pile? I don't think so. Three, four, five, six, seven eight nine. Didn't make it. So these cards are going to stay in my hand. Now, once you've got these piles, ask someone to pick any three piles they Let's say they pick this one and they pick this one and they pick that one. Perfect. Wonderful. Take all the other piles away and add them back to your hand. Then ask the person to choose two of these piles. Let's say they pick this one and this one. Turn over their top cards and then ask them to take the number ten and add to ten this value and that value. Well, ten plus nine is nineteen plus six is twenty five. Now all you have to do is take those cards in your hand and deal out twenty five cards. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty one, twenty two, twenty three, twenty four, twenty five. Wonderful. Now how many cards are left in your hand? Well, I've got here one, two, three, four cards. And that's a very special number because that is exactly the same as the value on this top card. This will work every time and here's why. As it turns out, the value of the top card on each pile tells us how many additional cards are in my hand. That's because every time I built a pile, I would put down a card and then I would put down thirteen more cards for a total of fourteen cards per pile, minus this mini card. That number of cards stayed in my hand. I skipped that many while counting. And so in this case, I don't have three piles of fourteen cards each. But if I did, I would have fourteen times three cards on the table, forty two. Well, I began with fifty two. So if these piles had fourteen in them each, I had skip anything, I would have ten cards in my hand. But in the case of this pile, six of them stayed in my hand, here four stayed in my hand, and here nine stayed in my hand. The number of cards in my hand is ten plus six plus four plus nine, which means when I don't know one of the numbers, I can figure out what it is by simply taking out ten cards and then six and then nine and the number of cards left in my hand will exactly match the value of the remaining top card.

7252504168345373998~1~History Facts #history #historytok #historytime ~History Facts That Will Make You Go What The Actual F**k Let's start with Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China. This dude was so scared of dying he sent hundreds of people across the sea to find an elixir of immortality. F**k spoiler alert, they didn't find it. Instead, he ended up dying from mercury poisoning, cause some genius told him mercury was the secret to living forever. So the guy terrified of death ends up offing himself in the most ironic way possible. Next we got Hans Steininger, the mayor of Braunau, Austria in the 16th century, who had the longest beard in the world. It was over 4.5 feet long. But here's the kicker, one day there was a fire in the town, and as Hans was running he tripped over his own beard, broke his neck and died. Are you f**king kidding me bro? And lastly, let's dive into the ridiculousness of Andrew Jackson's presidential inauguration party in 1829. This wild man opened the White House to the public and s**t got out of hand real quick. Thousands of people showed up, got wasted, broke China, trashed the place, and even caused a cheese avalanche when they tore into a block of cheese that weighed 1400 pounds. It was so bad that Jackson had to sneak out of a window and spend the night in a hotel.
7252046931134893354~1~#history #historytok #ww2 #ww2history ~This is one wild-ass story from the annals of World War II, the Battle of Los Angeles, aka the Great Los Angeles Air Raid. This shit is straight out of a Hollywood sci-fi flick, except it really happened. So it's February 1942, just a few months after Pearl Harbor. The US is in full war mode, and the West Coast is shit bricks over a possible Japanese attack. They're seeing nips under every bed, in every shadow. Suddenly, late at night on the 24th, radar picks up an unidentified object 120 miles west of LA. The city goes into DEFCON 1. The anti-aircraft guns are loaded. Searchlights pierce the sky. People are expecting the next Pearl Harbor any damn second. Then, around 3 AM, the sky lights up like the 4th of July. Guns are blazing. Shells are exploding in the night sky. People are screaming, running for cover, thinking, this is it. We're being invaded. Imagine the panic, the chaos, the pure, unadulterated terror. Searchlights are darting everywhere, tracing paths of anti-aircraft fire across the blackened sky. They think they've got enemy aircraft in their sights, but there's one little problem. There's no sign of any damn aircraft. No planes, no bombs, no parachutes, nothing. When the sun finally comes up, the city is in a state of shell shock. Thousands of rounds of ammunition had been fired into the sky, but not a single enemy plane was shot down. Hell, there wasn't even any sign that enemy planes had been in the area. So what the fuck happened? Aliens? Ghost planes? Mass hysteria? The government chalks it up to war nerves and a false alarm. They say the unidentified radar blip was likely a weather balloon. That explanation doesn't sit well with everyone, though. Some folks are sure it was a cover-up. The event goes down in history as the Battle of Los Angeles, the night when LA went to war with, well, nobody knows. And it just goes to show, in times of fear and uncertainty, sometimes the enemy we're fighting is our own damn imagination. Also, if you love history, I recently got a few violations on this account, so I won't post as much. So please go to my other account that I'll mention in the comments and follow it.

Beyond being just Alexa on wheels, Astro has some pretty cool features. It's probably the most versatile security camera on the market, with a telescoping camera that's able to look out a window, it can check in on things while you're away, like if you forgot to lock the front door, and it can even do automated patrols. There's a cargo bin on the back that can hold over five pounds. It can deliver drinks to people by recognizing their faces, with it managing to avoid spilling a single drop in our spill test. Astro has a really loud 2.1 speaker system. Making it a legit Bluetooth speaker that can follow you around your house. There's a USB-C charging port, so it's the only power bank that I know of that can come to you and then go charge yourself back up. But my favorite part about Astro is it's kind of like a robot pet, with its animated face and expressions and all the little noises it makes. It's cute like a pet, and it also acts like one too. It greets you when you come home, it has favorite spots that it likes to hang out in, and it even has little tricks, from acting like different animals to pretending to be a little robot vacuum.

7257529586806770986~1~The best-preserved dinosaur ! the Nodosaurus 🤯 #mystery #strange #science #discovery ~In 2011, while miners were digging in Canada, they stumbled upon something strange. It was even harder than rock, and it looked like a dinosaur. They called in scientists who then discovered the best-preserved dinosaur fossil in history. It was a nodosaurus that lived 100 million years ago. Its body would have been trapped in mud at the bottom of the ocean, essentially mummifying it. We know that it measured 16 feet long and weighed about 2,800 pounds. Traces of pigments were found, suggesting it had a rust-red color. Remnants of its last meals were even found in its stomach, showing that it was herbivorous. Another fascinating discovery, a perfectly fossilized dinosaur egg recently found in China. Inside is an embryo of an oviraptorosaur, a bird-like feathered dinosaur. And in 2007, a reindeer herder made this amazing discovery in Siberia, a baby mammoth perfectly frozen in ice for 40,000 years. While looking for a campsite, he spotted a blotch beneath the ice, and when he got home, he told his son about it. His son then decided to alert the authorities. Researchers named it Liuba, and even found traces of its mother's milk in its stomach and mud in its throat. They therefore think she choked while trying to free herself from a mud hole.

7254085362878926085~1~Darkest Discoveries Made By Humans Part 4 #scary #darkdiscoveries #dark #scarymovie ~Darkest discoveries made by humans. Zeno's Paradox. The paradox starts with a man deciding to walk from his house to the park. In order to get to the park, he first has to get halfway to the park. This portion of his journey takes some finite amount of time. Once he gets to the halfway point, he needs to walk half the remaining distance. Again, this takes a finite amount of time. Once he gets there, he still needs to walk half the distance that's left, which takes another finite amount of time. This happens again and again and again. You can see that we can keep going like this forever, dividing whatever is left into smaller and smaller pieces, each of which takes some finite time to traverse. So shouldn't the total time be infinity? This argument says that from traveling from any location to any other location should take an infinite amount of time. In other words, it says that all motion is impossible.

The next day, when you're on ice therapy, pour some cold water in there, let the ice chill it, take a deep breath, and then pour it and stick your face in the water as long as you can, which is probably gonna be about eight to 10 seconds before you get a cold headache. And then you go, that sucked, and you do it a couple more times, and then the next day you do it again. And now you didn't spend any money on ice. Since most of your temperature receptors are what's the densest ones are on your face, and you get your vagus nerve that way, you actually get really strong biological benefits and it didn't cost you anything. And you do this every night, imagine that your sleep improves, your nervous system gets stronger. Wow, so you can actually acclimate to colder temperatures by putting only your face into cold water.

7255765637211933979~1~What do we think about this?!😳~Why the hell is a hashtag trending today where people are groping themselves on camera for 10 seconds? Well, you can thank Italy for this bizarre content. Because they recently ruled that a 66-year-old janitor was not guilty of sexually assaulting a 17-year-old student because it didn't last longer than 10 seconds. The girl was walking up the stairs between classes when the janitor put his hand inside the waistband of her trousers and inside her underwear from behind. When she turned around and confronted him, he said that it was just a joke. He was charged with sexual assault and admitted to groping the girl without consent. But in trial, the judge dropped the case because it had only lasted between 5 and 10 seconds and that his hand had not lingered down her underpants for very long. And so, in an angry reaction to this ruling, people have started groping themselves alongside a timer to show just how long 10 seconds can really feel. The question is, do you agree with the judge's ruling or not?

7257623390276570395~1~MCDONALD&#x27;S FRENCH FRIES~If you go to McDonald's, anywhere in the world, you will find french fries, and you will find that they're always made from the same potato, the russet burbank potato from America that's unusually long and difficult to grow, but that's what they want. When you're at McDonald's, you like those red boxes with a little bouquet of very long chips. And they further insist that they have no blemishes at all. There's a very common defect of russet burbank potatoes called net necrosis, and you've seen potatoes with the little brown lines. Well, McDonald's won't buy them. And the only way to eliminate that is to eliminate an aphid, and the only way to do that is with a pesticide called Monitor that is so toxic that the farmers who grow these potatoes in Idaho won't venture outside into their fields for five days after they spray. And then when they harvest their potatoes, they have to put them in these atmosphere-controlled sheds the size of a football stadium because they're not edible for six weeks. They have to off-gas all the chemicals.

7226829817851809051~1~Damn Ohio jokes go way back huh?💀😳~Today, I learned that Cleveland, Ohio once released a staggering 1.5 million helium balloons in order to set a world record. But things went horribly wrong. The year was 1986, spirits were high, environmental damage was for hippies, and an entire city waited in anticipation as the event organizers counted down from ten. The moment these gigantic cloud of balloons were released, they rose up and started surrounding Cleveland's terminal tower. The idea was that they would all stay in the air, flying far away, until fully deflating and returning to Earth. But what happened instead was that they collided with a front of cool air and rain, causing one million balloons to fall back down, still inflated, causing absolute havoc. Cars started crashing because of distracted drivers, they had to shut down the airports to stop helicopters from flying, the balloons started clogging waterways all over Northeast Ohio. A moment's horses got spooked, which led to the event organizers being sued for $100,000 due to injuries. And the worst part? Because thousands of these balloons scattered the lake. Coast guards, who were trying to find two fishermen who went missing, described the rescue mission as looking for a needle in a haystack. Their bodies washed up two days later. And after all of this, Guinness World Records didn't even recognize the event.

7258201432367811886~0~Eye Doctor #fypシ゚viral   #brewstewfilms   #brewstew  #foryou  #viral  #funny  #shorts #funnyvideos~Last thing I wanted as a kid was a big ass pair of glasses hanging off my face. Which is unfortunate when you just so happen to be blind as shit as a kid. I was so blind. You know the big e on the seeing eye charts? Yeah. I couldn't even see that bitch. Be playing a little league as a kid. Be all the way out in the out feel didn't see shit and be like, hey guys, are we still playing? And school is even worse. The teacher would be like, do all these math problems on the chalkboard. Of course, I'm sitting a hundred thousand miles away, directly in the fucking hallway. Like, there's a chalkboard in here. My parents would take me to the doctor and they'd be like, our kid keeps running into walls. We think he's autistic. And the doctor was like, well, he's not autistic. He just can't fucking see anything. Why doesn't he have glasses yet? And I was like, shut your mouthhold, man. I don't want any of these goddamn glasses. When they test our vision in school, I would just wait and have a bunch of kids go ahead of me and just memorize what they would say when they'd read off the chart. Next person, Ez y x w v u t. Boom. You can all suck it. I can see just fine. The charts over there. So I go to the shitty ASI doctor. And if you've never been to the eye doctor before, then you don't know what hell on earth is. And one of the first tests they put you through is for glaucoma, and the doctors like put your chin up on this machine here and we're gonna shoot a little puff of air into your eyeball. Okay. You'll barely feel anything. Alright. Let's do the next die. Then they throw their torture chamber device on your head, start making a REIT stuff. Alright. Tell me what you see. Like, well, I still don't fucking see anything. But I feel obligated to at least make a guess like I'm playing some shitty Carnival game. Gonna give me an oversized stuffed gorilla if I get them all right. I'm like, am, a lowercase q, the at symbol, a goomba from Super Mario World. How am I doing, doc? You got them all right. Yay. No. Not even close. I was clearly blind this shit. They put me out in the waiting room and I'm looking at all these frames on the wall and I'm thinking, well, if I gotta wear glasses, I might as well go for the Jeff Gold them look. Because because he was fly a shit. And the doctor's like, easy there, sunny. Your family's insurance only covers these frames. And he points to one lonely shelf the most hideous glasses you've ever seen in your life, ones with double bridge frames in there. So your glasses won't break when the kids throw rocks at you. Glasses that would be bigger than kids book bags at school. I can't feel my nose. Well, that's because your fucking glasses are fourteen pounds. I'm like, oh, thanks a lot, doc. I said I said Jeff Goldboom, not fucking Jeffrey Dahmer. I'm not wearing these glasses, mom and dad. I'm gonna get kicked in the balls. Zachary gets kicked in the balls every day at school. Fuck that. I'll keep catching baseballs with my face before that happens. My parents are over there trying to make me feel better. Wow. You definitely look a lot smarter. No. I look like I'm gonna get my ass beat at schools, what I look like mom. But I did wear them outside of school because it was actually pretty nice to see things every once in a while. Everything didn't look like Nintendo sixty four graphics anymore. Everything's so vivid. I didn't even recognize my friends the first time I seen him again. Man, you guys look different. We're in the our ride home. I'm looking out the window, reading everything that I can. That sign says stop. That sign says speed limit twenty five. That sign says shut the fuck up. Okay. We get it.

If you're a fan of the game, you've probably recognized it and seen my videos a million times already. But one of the main reasons I love this game is the mods that make it absolutely realistic. Specifically these three mods. Ace is an absolute must-have as it completely revamps the game's medical system, fortification building, and ballistic systems such as fragmentation. Ams is a sound mod I've recently been binging. The explosion sounds are by far my favorite and it really gives a squad atmosphere to the game. Unreal Engine is a mod that completely removes the clunkiness of Arma 3 and smooths everything out to modern shooter standards.

You don't know what an airsoft gun is? Well, it's a plastic gun that kind of bridges the gap between a Nerf gun. And a semi automatic rifle. It's your little plastic babies. And after about a week, your whole house is littered with them. Your dad's dumping them out of the toaster. Your sister's digging them out of her ass crack. Just go around shooting a bunch of holes and all the lampshades. And I was the first kid on my block to get in there. So Got it. Out to show off to everybody. They're all mesmerized. I could conquer the whole goddamn world with this thing. My buddy, Dave, literally, took it out of my hand. And he's like, oh, sweet. This is sweet. David, what the fuck? It was my turn to shoot Mike on the face. It was a bit of a trendsetter I gotta say. He because, like, a week later, every kid on the block had an air soft gun. They didn't have a normal air soft gun like I did. They had this fucking battery powered M16 tactical shit. Fully automatic. Get shot in the face thirty times and four seconds. A lot of damn minutes. Jesus. I'm using this stone age piece of crap. My shit looks like a happy meal toy compared to yours. Michael's over there. Doesn't even have an airsoft gun. He's like shooting babies through a fucking straw like it's a blow gun. He's wearing his puffy ass winter coat in the middle of July and his body armor. It'd always be somebody out of ammo trying to call timeout. Wait wait wait a minute. Time out. Picture ain't no time out in airsoft. Get home with a bunch of red welts all over body like somebody gave you a small pox blanket. I eventually upgraded my arsenal through my hand gun out and purchased a big old sniper rifle. Things bigger than my entire body. Big ass scope on top of it like I was gonna assassinate a public official here didn't shoot fast like the other ones, but the thing had some power. My friends hiding behind a car and shit. I just shoot through the fucking car. First weekend, I got that rifle. Shout my cousin in the back. The following weekend, we had a closed casket funeral form. Now on one particular day, we were playing capture the flag. It's important to note at this time. They didn't put the big ass orange tips on these guns like they do nowadays. Let you know it's a fake gun. No. It just dab a bit of orange nail polish on the end of that bitch, call it a day. And that kind of makes it a little hard for your neighbors to determine if you're outside playing or if you're committing an act of domestic terrorism. Yeah. Hi. Nine one one. There's a child with a dear rifle and he's running a muck in the streets. I'm sitting there at my base, which is David's front yard. I'm peeking through my scope like I'm about to put Linden b Johnson into office. And I'm on the lookout for David. Where's David at? Well, David has ADHD. So he's not at his base, and he's not at my base. Well, I don't even know if he even knew he was playing at the time. But I forgot all about it, chasing a butterfly in shit. Now, David decides to walk to one of the busiest streets in the city and wave around what looks to be an automatic assault rifle in there. Imagine David's surprise. And about four seconds later, goddamn Patty wagon pulls up in front of him. A bunch of cops pile out. They got their guns drawn on this completely oblivious attention deficit child. I wasn't there. I was around the block waiting to shoot David in the teeth with my Kennedy killer, but I bet that turd in his pants. Was massive. It didn't take him long to figure out that David's gun wasn't real. Luckily, he wasn't massacred on the street right there and then loaded his ass in the back of a wagon, like a wild animal that he is, and they pull up to the front of his house. Now, it's there for this part. And I can say for sure that the turd in my pants was masked. One cop gets out and he's like, put that goddamn rifle down. So I threw it, like the gun was on fire. Dave comes out of the back of the truck, looking like shitty dentist, the men's car too. How do you think you guys are doing? We're just lying. Why is that kid wearing that puppy ass coats? Ninety four degrees outside? They was mom comes running out like they're filming an episode, a lawn order in front yard. Instead of getting a chance to meet iced tea, she's gotta deal with this bullshit. Now, the cops are really cool about this whole shitty situation. They gave David's mom our arsenal of plastic weapons. And they're all like, well, we could've murdered your kid and got away with it, but, well, we didn't so you're welcome. Why don't you give him a wiffle ball bad or some shit to play with instead? Jeez, it's Christ. So the moral of the story is don't be a fucking idiot waving a weapon around in the street.

This is my life and I'm being cut off! I'm missing things! Well, Taylor, since you're doing what you want with your hair, I'm doing what I want with my phone. You see, it's mine, because it paid for it. So I turned the service off. You are the worst! A couple of days without her cell phone, that just might do it. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. And just to be sure... Where's all my stuff?! If you're old enough to dye your own hair, then you're old enough to get your own stuff! You got rid of all her things? I did. Everything? Her bed, her dresser? All of it's in the garage. How did you... You know how when a child is stuck under a car, a mother's love can give her superhuman strength? Turns out, it also kicks in when a mother's really pissed. And you! You're coming with me to shop for your very own dinner. That sounds like fun. Sorry, Kitty, I just can't get my head around this. That dresser's 200 pounds! Rage, Greg. It makes me strong.

7256741771303013659~0~#CapCut #funny  #funnymoments ##foryou #fyp #random #xyzbca #ksi ~This is a key. It goes under my welcome mat in a very obvious place. Alex, why would you do that? Isn't somebody gonna break into your house? Well, actually, there are a lot of break-ins in this area, and every six months to a year I'll notice that the key is missing, which means people are trying. But here's the thing. It's not the key to my house. It doesn't unlock anything around here. The reason I put it down there is that if a robber finds that key, there's gonna be this moment in between the joy he feels thinking he's about to get in, to the disappointment realizing it doesn't work. And I hope that there'll be a moment of reflection there, where he'll think, what am I doing with my life? And maybe he'll change. Now you're probably also wondering, what is that key? I'll tell you. If any of you robbers are seeing this TikTok, look at the number on that key. It unlocks a safety deposit box at the West End Van City Bank in Vancouver, and in that safety box we've got some money, we've got a self-help book, and a chance for you to start a new life.

And I don't like the word rule. Well, if we don't like the word rule, let's call it leadership. Leadership in government is political power, and political power is an official form of antagonizing the people. What magazine did you say he edits? A commentary on current events. Pardon me, Lester. But, my dear young man, politics aren't necessary. Politics are rules imposed upon the people. In this country, rules are not imposed. They are the wish of all free citizens. Travel around a bit. Then you'll see how free they are. Yes, but you didn't let me finish. They have every man in a straitjacket. And without a passport, he can't move a toe. But if you'll allow me to... In a free world, they violate the natural rights of every citizen. But you don't let me... They have become the weapons of political despots. Yes, but may I... And if you don't think as they think, you're deprived of your passport. Will you allow me to... To leave a country is like breaking out of jail. Yes, but... And to enter a country is like going through the eye of a needle. But... Am I free to travel? Of course you're free to travel. Only with a passport. Will you allow me to say something... Only with a passport. Do animals need passports? Have you finished? It's in Congress that in this atomic age of speed, we are shut in and shut out by passports. If you'll shut up and let somebody else talk... And free speech, does that exist? No, you've got it all. And free enterprise. We were talking of passports. Today it's all monopoly. All right. Now will you allow me... Can I go into the automobile business and compete with the auto trust? If I can get in a word... Not a chance. Can I go into the grocery business and compete with the chain stores? Will you shut up? Not a chance.

And what better way to celebrate your love for wrestling than wrestling your dumb idiot friends in your neighborhood? Don't know if he could call it wrestling. It was more like just a bunch of eleven year olds being the hell out of each other, but we did the best we could. And to make matters worse, we did this in my a friend David's front yard. So we are on full display in front of the whole neighborhood. There'd be people walking down the street. Oh my god. Those kids are gonna hurt themselves. Oh well. Before a bunch of kids, we were actually pretty professional. I mean, we had like a referee, the chief styrofoam championship belts you got from Kmart. How even add a boom box out there to play your entrance music. Here, put my CDN and play track five. What the hell is this shit? What? What are you guys looking at? It's the only CDI app. Austin three six eight. Give me a hell. Yeah. So that once we were in the ring, I mean, the front yard, I guess. We would proceed to just beat the hell out of each other. Anyway, we could. And of course, we would get hurt. Mean hell, to this day, I get back spasms because of the one time I tried to do a missile drop kick off the fence, got forbid, but it was worth it. Be out there trying to imitate your favorite wrestler. Mine of course was Dwayne the Rock Johnson. Not not this Dwayne the Rock Johnson. I don't know who the hell this I'm talking this one. The old one. The Duane, do you smell what the rock is cooking, Johnson? I'd be out there saying one liners left and right. Do you smell what the rock is cooking? Just bring it, get your prony. There'll be people like walking their dog and shit. Why is that sixty five pound white kid keep calling himself the rock? I have no idea. And what the fuck is a Jabronie? Now, of course, if you're a wrestler, you have to have your very own finishing move. And my finishing move was called the Crippler Cross Face. How you do the crippling cross faces, you yank back on somebody's head really hard until they tap out or you snap their neck and you cripple them for life. Hence the name, the crippling cross face. And there was nobody I like doing that move to more than my next door neighbor, Michael. Because Michael was a dirty fighter. He was tripping shit, spit on your face while you're down in care. So he deserved every crippling cross face that he got. I mean, down there talking shit to him while I'm doing it. I'm the prom of both bitch. On the prom a ball. So you let him go when the match is over, but Michael's all but hurts still, so he kicks you in the ball. That's my fucking finish and move. How you like that? Winter and champion. Give me a hell. Yeah. And like I said, we would always rest David's front yard. But there was one time in particular, we decided to wrestle in this restaurant's parking lot that was across the street. Now, why would we wrestle in a busy parking one. Well, because we're dumbass eleven year olds. That's why. And dumbass eleven year olds do dumbass things like wrestle in a busy parking lot. So we have this street match, if you will, and it's between David and Michael. Now you had to watch out for David because David would do this really cool finishing move where he'd take your legs and then bend you backwards until your asshole touched the back of your head. It did not feel good, and I did not wanna be a part of it whatsoever. So they start going at it. And since Michael what it was. Dave has got him on the ground in about thirty seconds. Hey, if they met before, what? Because who met before. Your asshole in the back of your head. Allow me to introduce too. So there we are. In the middle of this restaurant parking lot, Michael's bent in half. He's crying like he got shot by a fucking rifle. Of course, some guy in his car sees us and he's like, what the hell is this? Kindergarten Fight Club bullshit? Hey. Leave that kid in the Scotty Pivot Jersey alone before I call the cops. We're not doing anything. I was just trying to introduce one body part to another. That's all. I'm all pissed off like god. Damn it. There's a Styrofoam championship belt on the line. I'm your own business. Get your brony. Your brony. I'm parked in Germany and Dutch Irish. I don't have a drop at your brony plot in me. Goddamn it. I'm calling the cops. No. There's no need to. See, look, he's alright. He's fine. How you like them apples? Winter and Stell champion. I am still the champion, the champion, the champion.

It was intended for your grandfather, the greatest plumber in the Milky Way Galaxy. But I found it. An accident. Unfortunately, your DNA signature was close enough to Max's that it allowed you to put it on. Why didn't you take it from me? I intended to, but your grandfather convinced me you were a better choice. He said you had the seeds of greatness. Really? Almost immediately, I thought I'd made a huge mistake. Your brashness and immaturity made a bad impression. Oh. Then I saw you grow. Witnessed your bravery and ingenuity, using the Omnitrix in ways that never even occurred to me. Me, the smartest being in three galaxies. Arguably, five galaxies. But then I let you down. You did. Disobeying my orders, hacking the Omnitrix. Turning Kevin into a monster. And now you've given the Omnitrix to the most dangerous being in the universe. Tell me what to do. How do I beat Vilgax and save the Earth? Not so easy to win without the Omnitrix, is it?

7256557110320745770~0~It it does happen again and this post does hit 100K, I’ll live stream it and give a live taste review. #brineshrimp #aquarium #ranchu #goldfish ~Have I ever accidentally drank the live brine shrimp while harvesting them? Well, not accidentally, but I did do it on purpose. Let me explain. So, last year, I made a video where I was harvesting some brine shrimp, and I just said randomly, you know, if this thing gets 100,000 likes, I'll do a video of me eating them, you know, just as a joke. And lo and behold, it actually got 100,000 likes. I think it actually shot up to over, like, 200,000 likes, which is extremely rare for me on Instagram. So, I'm a man of my word. I said, okay, looks like I'm gonna be eating some live brine shrimp. So, I made the live brine shrimp, and I made a video where I made it into some live brine shrimp iced tea. I ate some straight up. And the entire time, I didn't taste a thing. No taste. No taste. No taste at all. And I thought it was kind of weird. I was like, you know what? This is kind of crazy. Like, this is good protein. I don't taste a single thing. And then people in the comments were saying, ha ha, maybe Luke has COVID. You know, he doesn't taste anything. Well, two days later, I got extremely sick, took a COVID test. Turns out, I did have COVID. And after I told my followers that, they said, you got to do it again. But that was never part of the contract. I kept my end of the deal. So, I still don't know what they taste like. However, if this video gets over 100,000 likes, I'll do it again. This time, COVID free guaranteed.

7245860631893658922~0~#dog #dogs #dogsoftiktok #puppy ~Every time her husband gets her flowers, their golden retriever makes sure he's the one to bring it in to his mom. And you can see how happy he is running them to her. She said it's the greatest flower delivery ever. Every morning when he's getting ready for work, his dog and his daughter will sit together and look outside the window watching Dogwalkers and joggers go by. Even his dog wraps its arm around daughter making sure she doesn't fall. He said, every single day, this is their morning routine. Her dog and her baby are always together, and every day her dog ups up on her baby's chair to sit with them, so she made sure to record it and it's adorable. Safe to say these two have become best friends. When they were feeding her chips like a dog, their dog was watching this starting to get jealous. And when he thought it was now his turn, but they were giving it to her again, he pulled out a WWE body slam. This doll goes around a farmer's market and shops for its owner. You can see her touching the food she wants, and then the store owner will put it in her basket. She then picks it up and brings it to the next one and does the same. She's even walked up to a stranger and taps on them to get their attention so she can get some oranges for her basket. After the store owner gets her some, the dog then tells them she needs some little oranges. There have been moments of miscommunication though. When she went to get some oranges from this worker, she tapped on the horn she wanted and the worker gave her a few different ones. She then points at it again saying she wants this horn specifically and the worker says no. So she grabs the orange anyway, puts it in her basket like she'll just take it herself then and walks away. Every time they play this song, their dog starts doing a moonwalk. Every time they play this song, their dog does this. She brought her dog over to her dad's where he has a rooster and they immediately became best friends playing tag. The rooster would chase her dog around the wooden palettes, and the rooster would even play it smart by switching directions to try and catch her. There was even a funny moment where they didn't know where each other was for a moment, and the dog peaked around the corner and then jumped at the rooster scaring him. And the game of Tag continued. After she left her dad's and didn't return for several months, she thought they might forget each other until they met gan and instantly started playing together, an unexpected friendship that will go on forever. Ever since her dog named Kodo was a puppy, he'd find a stick to carry home from his walk. And years later, he hasn't changed. Only the size of the stick, even trying to bring home an entire tree branch.

7257899139579514138~0~#fouryou #movies #fyp ~A spoon-shaped alien creature suddenly appeared above Earth. He travels 2 million light-years just to find his own kind in the universe, but past experience proves that he is a unique existence. Just then, a blue planet appeared before his eyes. He quickly flew over the Earth and opened his third eye, carefully searching for objects on the ground. Soon, a spoon appeared in his view. The aliens are extremely excited because spoons are everywhere on Earth. He immediately activated his superpower and sucked them all in. For a moment, spoons all over the world broke free from gravity and uncontrollably released. For most regions, not being able to eat with a spoon is a disaster. Some military experts speculate that this could be an alien attack on Earth, attempting to starve humans to death by taking away the tableware for eating, but the female professor felt that humans should not initiate war on their own initiative, because aliens currently exhibit abilities that have a perfect chance of controlling something else. If it wasn't a spoon but a nuclear bomb that was sucked away, the harm caused by that goes far beyond that. In response to this crisis, some manufacturers have quickly launched milk that can be consumed without a spoon. At the same time, more and more spoons are flying away from Earth. Then some semi-finished spoons flew away through the roof. The weather forecast originally broadcast on TV has become a prediction of the flight direction of the spoon. At this point, a man looked at the magnificent scene before him, he couldn't help but grab a spoon, that's it, he was taken directly into outer space. At this moment, this alien is passionately kissing these fellow creatures living on outer planets. The man couldn't help but live stream on his phone and tell him, a spoon is just a type of metal tableware. Spoon star man remains unmoved, instead, using superpowers to control the spoon, formed a body size of his own. He finally found his girlfriend, and then happily left the Earth. Watching this distant alien, the man quickly asked, what should humans do without spoons? The alien turned around and suddenly gave a seductive smile. This man's stomach suddenly enlarged, he's pregnant, and the baby turned out to be a large spoon.

Oh, yeah, well, I have a lot of cameras pointing everywhere in the neighborhood. Yeah, ever since my husband died, I just want to make sure my family and I are safe. I totally understand. Maybe you can reposition that one. Okay, no worries, Captain. I will take care of that one later for you. Thank you. Have a good night. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, hey, one more thing.

7254373621597048107~0~Being Broke #fypシ゚viral    #brewstewfilms    #brewstew   #foryou   #viral   #funny  #funnyvideos  #funnytiktok~Alright. Being poor sucks. I wouldn't recommend being poor. I've been poor for most of my life. I've been living on my own since I was seventeen years old. I was seventeen. I live with my roommate brewer in a duplex. Now that right there should give you an idea of how much money we had. We couldn't even rent a whole house. We run at half a house. Our landlord's like, you guys get the top part. This random stranger gets the bottom part. You guys share a basement and make awkward conversation from time to time. You got it? Alright. Cool. And let me say our asses were broke living in that new place. I was so broke. If I found a nickel on the ground, I wouldn't just put it in my pocket. I'd bust out my wallet. And put that baby in there nice and secure. You're not going anywhere. I could buy out half a tosy role with you and there's nothing quite like being hungry and having no money. Just be sitting there sometimes. Well, we have no money until we get paid on Friday. What day is it? It's Tuesday. Well, looks like we're fucked. We had a good run. I guess it's time to kill ourselves. Yeah. I was thinking the same thing. What's the cheapest way to not feel hungry when you have no money? I'll tell you what it is. It's going to sleep. Just take your ass to bed. You can't feel hungry when you're asleep. Now can you? So you're using a cheat code. Alright. I'm gonna sleep for the next three days until we get paid again. Way me up when we can eat. There's one time we scavenged the whole house, checking underneath all the furniture for any loose change, and somehow we manage to scrape together a decent amount of money, and we were able to buy a whole box of hamburger helper. Oh, yeah. We're gonna eat good tonight. We're the grocery store frolicking down the aisle. We're dumping all our change on the counter. Like the cashier just hit a jackpot on a slot machine. We get home and brewer decides to cook this hamburger helper in what looks like the oldest, most decrepit pan I've ever seen in my life. It's got rust marks on it. All crusty and shit. This damn thing looked like he salvaged it from the Titanic. He serves it up and there's like these black speckles mixed in the food. Like, what is this? Pepper? Did you put pepper in this? No. It wasn't pepper. Spoiler alert. It was like the metal coating on the pan that scraped off mixed in with the food. Well, that's gross. What are we supposed to do now? And I'll tell you what we did. We ate it anyways. Not much of a choice there now was it. This tastes like soot in metal. Yeah. It sure does. Be people on fear factor that wouldn't even need this shit. And we're over here getting seconds. That's really not that bad. If you close your eyes and try to think of something else, if we weren't worried about food being on the table, we definitely were worried about getting utilities shut off every month and get a disconnection notice in the mail. For the gas, for the electric, for goddamn utilities, you didn't even know existed. You get a knock on the door. You're a high oxygen company. We're here to shut your shit off. Oxygen company. What the hell? Bring in the vacuum. We had our gas shut off for a whole summer one time. No more warm showers no more drier. That gas oven in your kitchen. Well, that just turned into extra counter space. That's what that is. We're not paying the gas bill. What are you crazy? Most people like having a functioning oven in their kitchen, you know. Some people even see it as a necessity. But us, no. We didn't need that gas oven. Just got an electric toaster oven and put it right on top of our old oven. There we go. Problem solved. Now we can make our toasters pizzas again. We had our water shut off for a week one time. Guess what? Now you got no working toilet. Where are you supposed to shit now? Smartie pants? If you have ever had the joy of having your water shut off, then you know that you have one remaining flush in that tank on your toilet You're better making count. So let's do some quick poop math. You could probably take like four shits in that thing and maybe like, I don't know, twenty he pisses before things start breaking the crest of the rim. So everybody in the house rushes to go to the bathroom, like it's the last helicopter out of Vietnam. Everybody, get in here. We're making the most out of this last flush. Now you can still use your toilet if you dump some water bottles in the tank, manufacture your own flush there. One time, I didn't have any water bottles, but I did have an old two liter of flat mountain dew sitting there in the kitchen. And I got to thinking, that'll work. Right? Why wouldn't it? There I am. Dumping mountain dew into a toilet tank so I can poop in it. It was probably at this moment in my life where I was like, man, I should really get my life sorted out. This is not how I pictured my life to bait. And while we're on this subject of pooping when you're poor, what are you supposed to wipe with when you got three nickels in your wall? Because toilet paper sure is shit as a luxury at that point in your life. I've wiped my ass with so many different substances from not having proper toilet paper gonna write a book on it. How to poop when you're poor. What to wipe with? What to flush with? I'm talking McDonald's, napkins, coffee filters. Start looking at how fluffy the cat is thinking, hey, you know what? There's a possibility if worse comes to worse. The cat's hiding under the couch and shit and no something's up. You're not wiping with me, buddy, no sir rate. But having the water or the gas shut off, that wasn't that big of a deal to us. We can deal with that. We'll make do. But where I draw the line is the Internet. We tried to pay that bill as best we could, but no matter how hard we'd try, we still got our Internet shut off probably about fifteen times be sitting there one day, trying to log into your MySpace, and you get one of these bad boys pop up on your browser. Oh, god, damn it. We don't have any Internet. What is this? Pakistan? How am I supposed to switch around my myspace top eight. I still have Tom in there for Christ's sake. Everybody's gonna think I'm some kind of loser. I won't gladly shit in some mountain do, but I will be damned if I don't have any Internet.

Now, we didn't have a lot of money when I was growing up, which meant we had some pretty shitty family vehicles when I was a kid. And when I say shitty, I mean, they look like cars that would be ran over by a monster truck shitty. We had cars with broken windshields. They'd have more rust on them than the Titanic because my dad love cheap cars. The cheaper, the better. No matter how shitty they are, I'd be sitting there in pasture's seat. Dad, why is that car on fire? Oh, it does that from time to time. It's just a little oil. It's fine. But I was used to as a kid. I remember riding in one of my his parents' car. My mind was blown. It was like, whoa. You guys have air conditioning. What are you guys from the future? But of all the shitty cars that we had, they were nothing compared to my dad's nineteen eighty four Subaru hatchback. I called it the rusty turd because well, because it looked like it came from somebody's asshole. That's why first time I've seen this thing. I remember thinking holy hell. Did my dad build his own car? Why don't he take the fucking lawn mower apart and make this thing in the garage? This thing was no Rolls Royce. Let me tell you. It was a stick shift, but it had no third gear. But my dad didn't care. Third gear. Who the fuck needs third gear? Dad, are we even allowed to drive this thing on the road? Don't know. But we're gonna find out, god damn it. We'd be driving down the road. People would be staring at us. Nami, look, that man's driving a car made out of garbage. Now another thing about this car was that the passenger door, like the randomly opened while you're driving down the road. So you'd be sitting there trying to roll down your window all of a sudden, your ass goes tumbling down the highway. So my dad fixed it by keeping it held shut with a bungee cord. There we go. Good as new. No problem. I'd be sitting there nervous as hell. How many seatbelts do we got in this car? I don't think I have enough seatbelts. That car was a deathtrap. The goddamn thing didn't even have turn signals that were. Turn signals. Who the fuck dates turn signals? Just yell at my window if I have to. Hey, asshole, I'm gonna turn left up here. Can you hear me? My friends were totally afraid of our car. They hop in the back seat wearing helmets and shit. It's your are gonna blow up? Probably not, but have your mom sign this permission slip just in case. My dad paid one hundred dollars for this car, a hundred bucks. Dad, I don't think we should drive anything that costs less than a washing machine, but he loved it. He brag about it to his friends and shit. Yep. Bought this thing for a hundred bucks. It's less than me two years. It's like a four dollar a month car payment. Now the worst thing about this car was that the starter was broke. So that meant if we wanted to go somewhere, we'd have to push the car to get going and then jump in, pop the clutch, start the engine. That's what we'd have to do every time we wanted to go somewhere. So every day, we'd be out there pushing this car made out of garbage, like some kind of shitty two man Bob sled team. My friends would be watching this from the sidewalk. What kind the weird circus shit is this. It was pretty goddamn embarrassing to say, Elyse, we'd be at the grocery store. We will be staring at some shit. Oh my god. I hope they're pushing that thing off clip, but after two years, that Subaru had enough. The transmission was destroyed, and my dad had to tie it to a tree and put it down. Well, Rusty Turd, your time is up. Time to die. And that was the end of it. But there was good news after all that. My dad scraped that car and got even more money than any pay for it. Yeah. We're just giving you this money so we don't have to see that pile of shit on the road anymore. Have a good day.
7244879908881632555~0~#dog #dogs #dogsoftiktok #puppy ~This woman is opening her own vet clinic and during construction, they were doing a concrete sidewalk that leads to the front door. So to make it unique, she decided to have her dog walk on it so his footprints would lead customers to the front. Something that her dog will leave behind forever. But at the end, she didn't expect him to take off running down it. She was taking her dog named Whiskey on a walk when her dog kept pulling her chasing after something. She couldn't figure out what Whiskey was trying to run after until she finally just let her off the leash and then realized that she was trying to catch the moon. She said, it was the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my life. Her dog kept asking to go outside during the thunderstorm so she finally just let him out and this happened. You wanted to go out, now go. Safe to say he won't ask again. While she was dancing in the kitchen, her dog came over and started to dance with her. Almost doing the same moves that she was, as if her dog was copying her dance. There you go, Bailey. After one of her dogs passed away the day before, she went outside to feed her other dog and when she came back out, she saw him trying to bury his food where his brother was buried and was sobbing the whole time. A heartbreaking video showing the true emotions dogs have. After her dog passed away from cancer, people always ask her why she hasn't fixed her couch. But she said it reminds her of her dog because this was her favorite spot to lay down. Every single morning when she would come downstairs, her dog named Nellie would be at the bottom waiting to greet her and would be so excited to see her every day. Even if Nellie wasn't feeling good, she would always be there. But as Nellie got older, she started suffering from dementia and other physical problems and would sometimes forget her routine. On her last day alive, Nellie was still by the stairs. After she passed away, nothing prepared her owner for the first day Nellie wouldn't be there waiting for, missing her best friend. Her dog is extremely scared of fireworks so on 4th of July, his mom put on headphones for him to block out the noise and then played some dog videos. And he seemed super happy with the setup. Her chicken seen the gate open and saw an opportunity to run away until it got caught and had to run back.

This is Brian. He's ranked as the number one Fortnite player in the world, and could be earning millions in tournament prize money. There's just one issue. I'm not playing that f**king game anymore. I mean, have you heard this s**t guy say when they play Fortnite? No, I don't play Fortnite. I'm a grown-ass man. Well, it's f**king disgusting. I've got two guys on me, two guys on me. They're absolutely dogging me. Bro, help me! I'm getting railed from behind right now. Oh my God, dude. This guy is literally eating my shots. I'm choking, I'm choking! If that's what they want to do, fine. But not me. I like girls. You're the number one Fortnite player in the world. Are you sure you like girls? Yes! Later on, we recorded a phone conversation between Brian and his mom. Oh, we want you to start playing Fortnite again, honey. What's next? You want me to get a husband? No one's going to judge you based off of a Fortnite call-out. Please, Brian. Our family needs this money. Brian, how do you feel after winning the million dollars? Um, it feels good. Next question. Brian, just before you won the Fortnite World Cup, you yelled, three guys just came from behind and destroyed me. I was wondering why you didn't just come out during Pride Month. That's not what I f**king meant by that. Next question. So Brian, you clutched a 3v1 to win the million dollars. Do you think that was easier for you because this isn't your first time taking three men at once? F**k this s**t. Brian later refused to donate his money to his little brother's life-saving brain transplant, claiming that he will never give another man brain.
7254505038805028138~0~Trampoline #fypシ゚viral   #brewstewfilms   #brewstew  #foryou  #viral  #funny #funnyvideos #shorts~Alright. We all had that friend growing up that had all cool toys that you never had. You get all jealous, like, oh, cool. Look, he's got a Nintendo six before, and I'm over here with three Lincoln locks. Cool. And that kid to me was my friend David. He had pretty much everything he wanted as in. For example, David had a bunk bed in his room, but David was an only child. So what the hell does he need a bunk bed for? I didn't know all your stuffed animals needed in place asleep. God forbid. He had all the cool stuff. He could top whatever you had by far. You finally got that sweet holographic charizard, Pokemon card. Well guess what? He's got three of them and they're all autographed by a real life charizard. Suck on that. The dude had three razor mini scooters, three of them. You need three scooters for David? You have two legs on your body. You're not a goddamn millipede. You don't need multiple scooters to ride around on. Out of everything David had, the trampoline in his backyard was the best. The day he got it, all the kids in the neighborhood just marveled at it. We can bounce to the moon on this damn thing. And boy, did we? We jumped on that thing and jumped and jumped and jumped our little asses off. We did that for like a whole fifteen minutes. Alright. That was fun. Now, what do we do? How about we try to hurt each other? Oh, yeah. I was thinking the same thing. Let's let's play a game called drop kick. How do you play drop kit? Oh, here I'll show you. That was the name of our favorite game to play on the trampoline. Drop kit. Not the most clever name but I got the point across. Now I'm gonna teach you guys how to play a drop kick. Alright? Rule number one. Be a dumbass nine year old kid. Okay. Check. We got that. We all qualify. Rule number two, try to injure your friends as much as possible. Only using your feet. Keep them in the teeth. Keep them in the belly. Knock the air out of them. God. I think I'm gonna throw up. Do anything you can to try to hurt your best friend. You made somebody bleed? Cool. That's one point. Knock the tooth out. Hey, that's two points. Alright. I'll look at that there. Comatose on the ground. Well, guess what? You're the champion now. You'd have kids wearing steel toe boots. I got my baseball cleats on ready to ruin somebody's life. Mike would be over there in his bare feet so he could move faster. That's what he always said. I had to be agile. Yeah, Michael, because God forbid, your knock off Jordans are really gonna slow you down. Michael, put your goddamn shoes out for Christ saying you're freaking everybody out. Jeez, that's Christ. Well, at least cut your damn toe nails once in a while with your nasty Wolverine fee god, you're disgusting. Rule number three, don't touch the ground. Now chances were that at some point somebody would kick you off the train. Wane. But if you touch that ground, you are out. You're done playing drop kick for that round. Michael, you're on the ground. You're out. No, I'm not. I'm in. I can still play Michael, your leg is broken in half, dude. Sit this one out. You lost. Sometimes you get kicked and you get lucky and be able to grab onto the chain link fence, you're backwards slide down at like a cheese grater. You fall back on a trampoline, your back's bleeding like a gunshot wound. I'm still in. I'm in. Okay. Carefully you step at slippery. There's blood all over the place. Then you'd have kids like my buddy's little brother, Matt, who was like a whole forty eight pounds at the time. His ass was so light. He jumped up too high. Stiff breeze could carry him right over the fence. He had the hardest time playing dropkicks because there wasn't any weight classes when we played. It's a little mat there. He'd have to face off against somebody like got like Corey, who had the physique of a middle aged garbage man. He's got like a hotdog in one hand. Yeah. Let's get it off. Corey couldn't even jump in the air. There's no way he's getting his big airborne. So he just fallen his butt. Launch Matt in the stratosphere. It's a technical knockout. Matt is disqualified. He didn't touch the ground. Well, you're not supposed to be in outer space either. He's disqualified. He's done. Rule number four. This is the final rule of drop kick. Don't get hit. By the Big Rock. Now you might be asking yourself, Big Rock. What Big Rock? Well, as if a bunch of nine year olds throwing their bodies around like a circus act wasn't dangerous enough, you'd put a big sixteen pound guard rock on the trampoline. There you go. Now you gotta dodge this big ass bowling ball rock while people are trying to kick you in the forehead. That sounds fun. This thing's flying through the air, landing on people's toes. You'd be looking the wrong way. Big ass rock comes out of nowhere. It breaks your pelvis. Little Matt's face is totally filled with terror. Knows if he gets hit with that damn rock. He's gonna he's gonna explode that impact. That's what he's gonna do. He'd have David's mom come outside and check on us. Hey, Anna. You guys want some lemonade? No. Nobody. Oh, you boys and your silly games. You could have other kids from the neighborhood staring at from a distance. Oh my god. What are they doing? Hey, you guys wanna play drop kick. What's it called drop kick, garden rock, trampoline game? No. We'll play hide and seek or something instead. Are you sure? It's really, really fun. There's a dead kid over here. Yeah, we know. He's disqualified. Hey, you guys got any band aids or some morphine?

And the first order I got was a doughnut order. Yeah. For a Bridgette. Have a good day. Got the doughnuts. I hope you wanted to buy one to the if there was a line, so I don't want to waste the cost missed time. I don't know why navigation wants to go a block down and then go up the block. Just so nice out here. The lobster here. There's usually security over here, but I guess not managers are coming early here or there before the gritty feet for no way. I need access. Just leave it down here. I made six dollars on these two doughnuts, which is more expensive than the doughnuts itself. Customer probably ordered two doughnuts and paid about fourteen dollars doughnut. This time for myself, it made me one one. I had this one with cream inside. Right? With the very cream? Yeah. One of those reason. Yeah. I saw it here. That was your factory. Twenty nineteen, I saw come here, get doughnuts. How much? A dollar seventy five. A dollar seventy five? Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good day. It's crazy how after, like, years, you just past your old job, and it makes you like it makes you appreciate where you are right now rather than where you were before. No. I ordered one doughnut look, she put me two huge donuts and there's like four mini donuts in there. I got all these for one seventy five. Shout out to that lady, Shout out to Big John's. I think that was source name. I'm definitely not gonna be able to eat all this. Whoa. Don't you fall, boy? This is bad for my health, but this is why I signed up for deliveries, you know. And then of the day, I'll just burn everything I eat and try to put these in the bag. Got it in the bag. Okay, buddy. To that cream. It's a very beautiful ass. I don't even know how I used to eat these all day every day as so bad. Anybody home? You want some doughnuts? Here. I got you a doughnut right here. Do you have water with you? Yeah. You're good? You're welcome. Look at that. So beautiful today. Now the question is, is it worth it to wake up that early for deliveries? Orders aren't gonna be that busy at six AM in the morning than it is at ten or eleven AM in the morning, but it's a really nice experience. You get to, like, ride your bike, get some fresh air, start your day good. Who wouldn't wanna be outside when the weather is like this?

7258365478630968618~0~This turned out so good. Just like you asked… all in one part;) #artist #concept ~The moment has finally come for the one and only number 23, Michael Jordan. I think this is my best piece yet. I'm doing a series where I am painting 30 iconic numbers using my new three-dimensional paint stroke technique. Number 7 was up first and you guys went crazy over it but this one might top it. Don't worry, this one is all in one video. Unlike the first one, this painting has two numbers which prompted a problem. I had to figure out how I wanted to display MJ on the 2 and the 3 without it looking weird. I ended up making each individual number a separate image. For the 3, I did an iconic portrait of him dunking and then for the 2, I did one of him mid-shot. To make the two numbers cohesive, I added a blurred crowd background effect that would appear behind both of the bodies. Ironically, the two people for my series I picked first both have the same color scheme, red. I promise the next one won't be. I just have to do a little touch-up on the edge of the numbers but then we should be good to go. This ended up turning out so good and I hope you all love it as much as I do. The original and limited prints are on my website. Let me know who you want to see in this series next.

Surprises let me know she cares. Thirty seconds. In there! Okay, I'll go! Fill that up! Did you want any small bills in case you have to tip or anything? Shut the fuck up! Some sandalwood? I'm in danger. Faster! Move! Enough! Time! Hey, hey, look, you know, it's not too late to do the right thing. I'm sorry. Thank you for your cooperation, everyone. Especially you, Owen. You.

Yeah, no, even if I wanted to switch, I think it's more important that your daughter learn a valuable lesson. That's not how the world works, you know, you don't always get your way. Are you for real, dude? Okay. It's still not working. Yeah, I see that. Just punch it in manually and give her the coupon price. Dave, Dave, hold on, wait. Can I take a look at that before you make the transaction? Before you punch it in? Sorry, folks, we're just gonna be a minute. Alice will help you on one.

I'm the loss prevention officer for all the A&G Family Marts. You're lucky I was here today to spot this little guy. Take a look here. See that expiration date? Does that look familiar to you? November 31st? It shouldn't. It's only 30 days in the month of November. So whoever tried to replicate this little guy, clearly they didn't look at a calendar. Probably out of China. You know, they script the dates all the time. There's always a flaw. I mean, if you know what to look for, it's easy to spot. Well, can you just make an exception? I mean, we could just honor it, Ken, this one time. She's been coming here for, like, 150 years. Yeah, I don't care if she's Dame Judi Dench, Dave. Leave the food out, the critters will get it. This is how this starts. I'm just saying. Sorry to compare you to rodents, ma'am. I didn't mean that. I just mean to say the rules are rules. But if it helps... If it helps? I have hemorrhoids. You know what helps, honey? Preparation H. Well, we're happy to sell it to you at full price. Well, then why don't you buy it? Because you're a giant asshole. That's a good one, ma'am. But as Dave will attest, I've been told that before. You should put that in the burn pile. See you, Dave. I'll be back next month.

7258768379287211290~0~Can spider man swim ? #spiderman #spiderman2 #spidermanmilesmorales #gaming ~Let's see if Spider-Man can swim in all the Spider-Man games. In Spider-Man, released in 2000 you can't swim, you'll sink straight to the bottom. In Spider-Man the movie, a big graphic evolution, unfortunately there's no deep water, so we won't know if he can swim. We continue with Spider-Man 2, and when you dive into the water, what happens is that there's a cinematic that automatically pulls you out. Ultimate Spider-Man, it's the same problem as with Spider-Man 2, as soon as you go into the water, it instantly pops you out, so you can't swim. We continue with Spider-Man 3, and there's a change where not only can you go into the water, but you can also swim, and he can even do the breaststroke. For Spider-Man friend or foe, unfortunately he can't swim anymore, so it retransports you from where you jumped. For Spider-Man Web of Shadow, you can swim again, but there's no real difference with Spider-Man 3. On The Amazing Spider-Man, the water is very well worked out, but yet you can't swim, Peter will directly pull a web to get out of it. On The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the graphics are further improved, but Peter still doesn't like water. We finish with Marvel's Spider-Man, which is a beautiful game and also a very good one. The water has been really well cared for, you can swim again, and it seems that Peter is no longer afraid of water, unlike the last two opuses.
7258669252369075499~0~What’s your dirtiest secret? #creeky  #minecraftparkour  #reddit  #redditstories  #redditreadings  #askreddit~What's your dirtiest secret? I am a girl. I'm not a host. I'm rather picky about my boyfriends, and it's caused me some trouble in the past. In my late twenties now, but this story isn't about that. It's about ten years ago when I was sixteen and in high school, being a shy girl that did all ride inquire. I was picky about my boyfriend's then too. I preferred someone musically inclined who wasn't outgoing, but still confident. Someone who was sure of themselves and didn't need to tell the world hear it from the world. There was one guy that almost fit the description, Chris, he wasn't good in music at all, but he was the com type that just made things okay. And I wanted him. Bad. So junior year prom, I went with some friends but no date. My parents were a little concerned I wasn't dating thought I might be gay. I assured them that this wasn't the case, that I was flying solo that night so I could keep my options open and dance freely. Maybe I'd meet a great boy for my senior I really had no intentions of all of this. I wanted Chris, I wanted him inside of me bad. Not so conveniently, we were in the same of friends that went together to dinner. Cheesecake Factory, I had a plan. Some people debated appetizers, Chris was one of them. I encouraged him for said I'd split one with him. Another friend offered to help lessen the load and Chris did admit he hadn't had lunch. So we order an appetizer and he tears into it. I mean, this guy was devouring the food like it was the last god damned meal on earth. It was really impressive, and then the main course was ordered. I kept myself to a small meaty dish, can't remember what exactly. Pretty sure it had an eight ounce of steak to it. I just remember the important part. He had a large salad. Think its lack of carbs would offset the appetizer. Things were going better than expected. Dessert was some cake all around. That doesn't matter so much. When we got to the dance, I hit the floor a few times, had some punch and kept an eye on Chris. There was something about him that made me keep my eyes on him all night. And when the time was right, I did the creepiest thing I've done in my life. He talked a lot about how he ate too much. How the appetizer, all to himself and a salad, were a bad combination. I saw him hurry to the bathroom at one point. Fiber was my hero that night. When I saw him exit, he looked embarrassed and I heard him tell a friend to not use the men's restroom at all for the rest of the night. I could not pass this up. I couldn't let this opportunity slip by. So I ducked into the restroom and a horrid, terrible smell invaded my nose. He had pooped. No one else was in the bathroom. They probably evacuated during his poop campaign and it wasn't hard to find which doll it was. The handicap of course. I knew I hadn't been seen, that no one else would dare enter after smelling that. Except me. Me and my newfound Fed I went into the stall, horny beyond reason for a sixteen year old girl and saw the steaming warm pile of fecal matter that had stopped up the toilet, sitting beneath the mound of toilet paper that had made his butt clean. In hindsight, the best part was probably me cleaning the seat first. I made sure no stains were on my dress as I sat down immense restroom on the plastic seat of that godforsaken toilet. No. Not even the toilet paper touched my dress, but I could sit up it, wallow in it. I didn't want to risk anything, so I lifted my legs up and spread them a bit for balance. With this, I also leaned back to offset the legs staying above the calls walls. I didn't want my shoes and dress to be seen. But here I was in this half lane position over a stopped up toilet full of poop from the man I craved most. I inhaled deeply and went to town in my other regions, not even bothering to remove underwear. The aroma just filled my lungs and I managed to half stand, half lean against the stalls wall and take one more deep breath for memory sake. I can still smell it. The rest of the night was uneventful. I kept thinking about it, touching myself a little. Got off on it again later that night when I got home. Never got with Chris, but I found a good number of public bathrooms that I can get into without being seen. Women's fecal matter doesn't do it for me. It has to be guys. And I don't regret a thing.

They always just brag about how expensive their life is. Like, oh, Joey just started private school. It's so expensive. And our remodel is totally going over budget. Oh, and you wouldn't believe how much money we spent going to Fiji. I'm like, okay, Katie, I see your life, okay? It's a luxury, it's good for you, okay. Black people on the other hand, a lot more straightforward. Black people just tell you exactly how much money they spent on something. It's great. You guys seen it? Like my black friends or even like rappers, right? They love to brag. They're like, this car, 80,000. My mama's house, 500,000. This chain, a million dollars, man. I'm like, okay, you clearly don't have your priorities straight, but I appreciate the honesty. People love to brag about how much money they spent. Asian people, on the other hand, we do the exact opposite. We love to brag about how little money we spent on some shit. Because the art is in the savings. You never pay full price. Like my mom, her catchphrase is, guess how much? Guess how much? That's what people. You guys ever play guess how much? My mom would come home with something new, like a watch. She'll be like, Jimmy, Jimmy, guess how much? Guess how much? I'm like, mom, I don't know. It's a very nice watch, like $5,000. And she was like, no, it's $200.

This detailer's coming to my house later today, so we set the prank up and filled my truck with 300 gallons of water. Here's the plan. He's gonna start by washing the outside, and then he'll start cleaning the inside of the car, and that's when I'll text him, reminding him to vacuum my truck bed, which will lead him to open this trap door, causing water to flood out everywhere. Now that it's all set up, we just have to wait for him to arrive.
