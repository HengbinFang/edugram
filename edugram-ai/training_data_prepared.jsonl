{"prompt":"Remember this is only my thoughts for MY wedding, no judgement on anyone who has done or is doing it more traditionally ???? #bridesmaids #bridesmaid #weddingtiktok  | Here is how I'm dealing with the whole bridesmaids thing at my wedding and how I'm doing it differently. And I'm really excited about this. So first and foremost, they are not called bridesmaids because you are not my maid. You're my friend and I'm inviting you to this wedding and I don't expect anything of you other than to show up with a good attitude. You're my bridemaid. You're my friend. Number two, I am having a, I don't even want to call it bachelorette, I'm having my friends, my bridesmaids come a couple days early before the wedding because it's in Florida, a little vacation. You could call it a bachelorette trip if you want, but it's like nothing official and I'm doing it all at once so that they don't have to worry about taking off work twice and they also don't have to worry about paying for two separate trips. I am letting them pick their dress basically completely. I've got like a very big color palette and they can pick the style, they can pick everything. I want them to feel comfortable and confident and we all have different body types and styles and comfort levels and it's important to me that they feel best on the day as well because if they feel their best, I know I'll feel my best. Next, I'm not having them stand next to me like while we're doing our ceremony. Yeah, they'll just be sitting probably in one of the first few rows and they'll be able to enjoy our ceremony instead of having to like be a robot. I will not be whisking them away for two hours after the ceremony to take pictures. We're gonna do pictures in the morning. I'm gonna get ready first thing in the morning. We're gonna do like bridesmaids pictures and then we'll do our first look and then we'll do the other pictures and then we'll do the ceremony. So that way, after the ceremony, we can enjoy the evening and being married and start having fun and all that stuff instead of having to worry about going off and taking pictures and leaving our guests hanging. The wedding is a year and a half away so I still have a lot to plan. I could add more things. There could be more of these coming but as of now, that's all I've got. Let me know if you have any suggestions of things that you also found worked really well to make it super chill, super fun, and not your typical bridesmaid, political, not fun climate.  ->","completion":" True."}

{"prompt":"This is the best party trick  | Shows there's no hole in your cup. But when you drop it like this, you do this, and there we go, you separate the liquid from the ice. I'm going to show you how to do the best party to it. So all you need is two cups. So first of all, what you do is you pierce a hole on the bottom of one cup so that come in here. So as you can see now, I pierce a hole in there. You can see that. Right? And you cut out the bottom of this. Not too much are okay. What we have is this. Okay. So you can see the hole in a cup. Yeah. So that's the first step. Okay? We'll leave that there. The second step is you take another cup And make sure they have rigid lines on it like this because it is going to hide something. So when you get plastic cuts, make sure there's two lines in there and k? You then take it and what you do is you just cut just here just on the top of the line. Okay? If you wanna cut just on the top of that line, these are a bit blunt to make sure you got sharp scissors or use a razor blade. But if you're a child, then please make sure you have an adult with you. Okay? So what Now what you do is Family friendly show. Happy. Let's try show. You don't wanna beat you don't wanna cut your fingers. And then what you do is, as you can see, you cut around this just like this make sure you cut on the line because you want this to be hidden, okay, to be cut just above the line. Obviously, I'm doing this far, so this isn't gonna be perfect. I'm just doing this to show you how this works. So there we go. Get rid of that. You don't need that. This is it. This is your gimmick. A wholly one cup and then you cut the bottom section off of another cup. You then place this on there like that and there we go This right here is your gimmick. So now what you do is you fill it up with ice and then you fill it up with liquid and I'm gonna show you what you do next. Put up a cup with the ice just like this. So this obviously hides the hole. Now don't worry about this line here. Obviously, I've cut this wrong, but that's what I said you need to cut it above it, so it blends in with this line here. Okay? So now what you do is once the ice is in, you're gonna take your liquid whatever liquid you want, you then fill it up just like this. And now this is gonna blow your mind. Like I said, this is the best party trick. Especially now a football's coming on, they're gonna be using plastic cups. So do this in a bar. You're gonna win yourself free drinks, all night. Like I did. So watch this. Right? So there we go. That's probably enough. Now right now, it looks horrendous. Because you can see, like, the the the different color I can't do. Right? So you can see the Gimme. So it looks rubbish. So here's what you have to do. You have to get the liquid out here on the outside of this. So all you do is you lift up just to see what I'm doing here. Juts, like this, just like that. There we go. So now as you can see, it all blends in. Yeah? Or can you sort of still still see that? So obviously, you need to make sure it's perfect. So there we go. Just like that. So now Obviously because it's a bit cold, you can sort of see it. If you're holding it like this, you can't see anything, can you? Can you see anything? No. I can't So then while it's dripping everywhere, I'm gonna show you how to do it. Right? So then once you're set up, now you're set, you can hold it like that. You can't see anything. So here's secretly say to them, I'm gonna separate the ice from this drink without putting my hand in. And how you do it? Is this watch? There. There. Now that's the selling point because it shows there's no hole in your cup. But when you drop it like this, you do this and there we go, you separate a liquid from the ice and that's how you win yourself a free drink.  ->","completion":" True."}

{"prompt":"It would change everything. Whats your opinion on this crazy theory ? ?  #truthseeker #truth #mystery #earthmysteries #antarctica #antarcticasecrets   | We all know that Antarctica is the most mysterious and intriguing continent that exists. Recently, an incredible theory has been spreading and could completely change our perception of this territory. According to this theory, Antarctica is not a vast expanse of ice at the bottom of the earth, but rather a gigantic wall of ice surrounding all the continents of this world. Some even believe that if we were able to cross this ice wall, we would discover other continents that have intentionally been kept hidden from us. In 1992, a new standard world map called the Gleason Map was published, depicting Antarctica encircling all our continents. A very intriguing fact is that the logo of the United Nations strongly resembles this map. A pilot took the risk of going there despite the prohibitions and released a low-quality video claiming to have reached this ice wall, but we cannot be sure if it is truly Antarctica or if it is staged. Scientists have long established that Antarctica is indeed a continent, thanks to satellite images that show its structure and expanse. Therefore, it is important to rely on solid evidence and serious research to understand our world. So, is this theory simply the product of the imagination of some individuals, or are all our beliefs biased?  ->","completion":" True."}

I am Leonida Chancile, better known as the soap maker of caregio. I was born in Montela, Italy, on November fourteenth eighteen ninety three. At the age of twenty one, I married Rafael Pennsardi with whom I had four children. But when my unemployed husband became an alcoholic over the years, I left him. However, this was not to be my only stroke of fate. When my favorite child and eldest son Giuseppe was called up for military service, I could no longer find peace out of fear for his life. I developed a secret and creepy plan that involved making human sacrifices to protect my son from any evil that lay ahead during the war. Divination and terror cards were the perfect way to attract act future victims. I decided to act and invited friends from the neighborhood over for tea and cake. My first victim was my friend, fuss Dina Seti. When she came over one day, I offered her glass of wine. In this glass, I had previously dissolved sleeping pills. When Faustina fell asleep, I took an ax and cut her body into nine pieces. I threw the pieces into a cauldron, added seven kilograms of sodium hydroxide side and stirred until it was a dark, thick mass. From this, I made a soap, which I later sold in my small store. With the victim's blood, I waited until it had coagulated and put it in the oven to dry. Then I mixed it with flour, sugar, chocolate, milk, and eggs. Lots of crispy cookies were baked from it, which I distributed to the next guests and visitors. I myself and my children also aid from them. In the same way, I later killed my two other friends before processing their bodies. Again, I distributed the bars of soap and cookies as gifts to neighbors and acquaintances. But when the sister of my last victim became concerned about her sister's whereabouts, she contacted the police. Since she was last seen in front of my house, the police eventually searched the house where they found the jewelry of the victim. I was arrested and after confessing, sentenced to thirty years in prison followed by three years a care facility for the mentally disabled. Of this sentence, I served only twenty four years. Because on October fifteenth nineteen seventy, at the age of seventy seven, I died in potashwale prison after suffering a stroke. Some of the objects, such as the ax and the cauldron that served as murder weapons and instruments, can still be seen today in the criminal museum in Rome.  ->","completion":" True."}

Eventually, they fell in love and tied the knot in a fabulous wedding in twenty ten. But has it been smooth sailing ever since? Here are some strange things about Chelsea Clinton's marriage. Six months after Chelsea and Mark tied the knot, the split rumor started swirling. New York CBS too alleged that their young marriage was, quote, collapsing under pressure from work and family. And that she was seeking an enrollment. The publication based this on the fact that Mark was in the middle of a break from his job as an investment banker in Wyoming, skiing while Chelsea stayed in Manhattan. However, one daily news gossip columnist claimed divorce wasn't in the card, saying, I think a lot of people are hoping that there's trouble between Chelsea and Mark. It's just not the case. They're still in love. Mark ski trip was a war crisis. During a twenty twelve vogue profile of Chelsea, her chief of staff that the Clinton Foundation said the tabloid gossip taught the couple a valuable lesson explaining none of it was true. But what put a strain on them was that the stories are being written because none of us were paying attention to it. It was an eye opening lesson. Chelsea realized, maybe I need to get out there and he mystify myself a little bit. Despite growing up with politician parents and enjoying arrears in private equity, Chelsea and Mark seemed to be polar opposites. In her twenty twelve vogue profile, readers got a glimpse into their personalities. Mark describes himself as Just a nerdy Jewish boy from Philly. But you know, Bill Clinton grew up with a dirt floor in Arkansas, so it's all relative. Chelsea's very much the yin to my yang. Don't want to say I'm aloof, but I definitely can exist in the cloud. I walk into parking meters. She's the antithesis of that. She's like, this is where the parking meters go. However, Mark being a bit of a self described airhead makes him that much more endearing to those in Chelsea Circle. One of Chelsea's best friends told the mag, these are real men. We were always rooting for them to get together. Chelsea's chief of staff for the Clinton Foundation agreed saying, he's this playful schoolboy stuck inside this wicked smart, really astute adult body. He's his happy goofing off as he is talking finance with world leaders. He's the best of both worlds. Another fun fact, Mark her up with eleven siblings. Chelsea, of course, grew up with a secret service. You can't order a pizza to the White House. I'll just tell you that right now. And and we did sometimes there were When you're the only child of a political dynasty, you can be assured that your wedding won't be a simple affair. Their wedding planner told today at the time it's going to be very understated, elegant, but befitting a royal wedding for the US understated. Chelsea and Mark's twenty ten wedding at New York's ass their court's estate reportedly cost up to five million dollars, including the fifteen thousand dollars worth of porta potties with porcelain toilets that any of their five hundred guests could visit according to TM's C. Guests at the lavish wedding included such mega stars as Oprah Winfrey, Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks according to the BBC. Additionally, citing a VIP moment, the Federal AV administration and forced a no fly zone over the Hudson River venue for a full twelve and a half hours according to NBC News four, New York. Mark makes his living as an investor, but there's one small problem. He can't seem to hold on to a job. According to deal breaker, a site that covers the financial industry, Mark seems to always fell upwards. After spending six years at Goldman Sachs, Chelsea's better half struck out in his own, and it wasn't great. He spent a few years at three g cap before going on his three month ski trip. Then decided to launch his own hedge fund, Igo Vail Partners. But according to The New York Times, the fun close two years later, after losing nearly ninety percent of the twenty five million dollars it raised from investors. A few months later, Mark took the vice chairman job at the investment firm, Social Capital, and he was there less than a year. In October twenty nineteen, he was hired as the managing director of the private equity firm, TPG. All of this wasn't from a lack of trying. Political reports that in a hacked email released by WikiLeaks, ex Clinton a Doug Band claimed that Mark leveraged his connection. With the Clinton's to raise money for his hedge fund. And also claimed that Chelsea was setting up meetings for her husband that resulted in investments from several major donors to Clinton Foundation and the Clinton campaigns. While Mark is still trying to find a job that lasts longer than a few years, he can also count on Chelsea to make sure the bills are paid. According to the New York Post, Chelsea made nine million dollars in salary and stock options since twenty eleven by sitting on the board of Internet investment firm IAC. In twenty seventeen, Chelsea joined the Board of Expedia Group earning an estimated two hundred fifty thousand dollars. And despite having no TV journalism or any journalism experience, political reports that Chelsea earned an annual salary of six hundred thousand dollars at NBC News as a special correspondent. And apparently, it's all paying off. In twenty thirteen, Chelsea and Mark moved into a ten million dollars New York City apartment described as a luxury fortress by The New York Daily News. According to The Daily Mail, the five thousand square foot apartment is the longest apartment in the city.  ->","completion":" True."}

{"prompt":"Reply to @jessca4765 #foryoupage #fyp #foryou #powerlifting #bodybuilding #deadlift #fitness #workout #fittok #powertok | Why do metal plates feel heavier than non-metal plates? Well, there's two reasons for this. If we're talking about, you know, strictly traditional cast iron plates, they are somewhat chiefly manufactured because they don't have to go through a calibration process, so there could be a plus or minus five difference in weight. So a 45-pound plate could easily weigh anywhere from 40 to 50 pounds, and I've even seen more extremes with like 53 pounds. So that could be one reason. Number two, if we're talking about steel calibrated plates, would I use for powerlifting? Probably because it is a smaller plate. Um, there's not as much surface area being covered, so everything is, you know, condensed into that one surface area. Now, if we're talking, you know, rubber plates, you know, what they use in CrossFit, for example, because there is more weight distribution, or rather there's more surface area for the weight distribution, so we'll say a 45-pound plate, for example, it has the potential to feel a little, like, less heavy or a little lighter than a steel calibrated plate, for example. But at the end of the day, weight's weight.  ->","completion":" True."}

{"prompt":"Nasty burn with these #fyp #foryou #foryoupage #gymshark #fitness #bodybuilder #gains #workout #legday | Alrighty, so this is a great supplementary exercise to target the quads and build some mass. As with every muscle group, I think it's most efficient to implement both high and low reps, so I wouldn't say this should replace squats in their variations, but I do think it's a great finisher or accessory. Additionally, I can't see it being sustainable to go heavy with as it puts the knees in a very stressed position and will be hard on the tendons with heavier weight. That being said, the Smith machine allows you to forget about balance so you can push your knees way out over your toes and therefore lengthen the quads through their full range of motion. It's great for time under tension and metabolic fatigue and you can really produce some mechanical tension which is the primary driver of muscle growth because you can arguably go to failure more safely. It is important to make sure you keep the stretch entirely on the quads by not going so deep that your back has to round because at that point your lower back and hips will start to sustain the load. Mess around with your feet positioning a little bit and find out where it feels the best so you can get the best contraction and pump.  ->","completion":" True."}

However, with that being said, I will try to explain the ingredients that you should look for when buying a pre-workout. I think pre-workout definitely has its place, but it's important to note that you shouldn't rely on it or use it to make up for bad recovery practices. The dosage of all these ingredients has a range, and I think it's likely better to start small so that you don't fuse up your tolerance right away. Depending on whether or not you're looking for a pre-workout that has stimulants in it, caffeine is probably the number one ingredient you should keep an eye out for. The second ingredient you should look out for is citrulline and its derivatives. It improves the ammonia recycling process as well as nitric oxide metabolism. In other words, it gives you a nasty pump and improves endurance by providing the muscles with more nutrients throughout the workout. Number three is beta-alanine, and this is what gives you the tingles. It improves muscular endurance in higher rep sets by buffering the production of lactic acid.  ->","completion":" True."}

And then, say you want to eat 200 grams, once the number gets to negative 200 grams, you know that you've taken 200 grams worth of yogurt out of the container.

The part of your tricep that is closest to the elbow. Triceps are seriously underestimated by most people when it comes to bench strength. Matt Wenning and Louis Simmons both preach this and they know what they're talking about to say the least. Due to the length tension relationship and where the different heads of the tricep attach, my favorite exercise to target the medial head of the tricep is decline dumbbell skull crushes. The dumbbell should start somewhere around your ear and end up in line with your forehead, but play around with it until you feel the contraction by your elbow.  ->","completion":" True."}

What I'll see a lot of people do, especially beginners, when they go for a squat, they'll just unrack Mach 5 and they won't let the bar just settle. There's really no better way for me to put it. So this is what it looks like.

{"prompt":"Its a no from me. Be smart and work hard #fyp #foryou #foryoupage #gymshark #fitness #bodybuilder #supplements | So I'm getting a lot of people asking about or recommending the use of sarms and secretogogues in my comments, and I wanted to touch on that. Also known as selective androgenic receptor modulators, sarms are hailed as the next generation of anabolic steroids due to yielding similar results without the side effects. This is not true. For starters, they're essentially a completely unregulated industry, and according to Dr. Bill Llewellyn, you likely will not get what you paid for. With that being said, on the off chance that you do get what you paid for, the risks are unknown. I don't know much about them, because nobody does. Regardless of what anybody might tell you, there is minimal literature to support a particular stance within one way or the other, so it's impossible to know much, if anything at all. For example, James English of Gymshark recently said on Instagram Live that his blood work was negatively affected by taking sarms, even though the common but false narrative says that that won't happen.  ->","completion":" True."}

About two days ago, the rest of my baby axolotls hatched and I started a hatchery. Then a big axolotl creator here on TikTok responded, and she said I was doing a ton of stuff wrong. She was super kind about it and it was so helpful. Firstly, I was using Aquasave, which she told me was toxic. But prior to using the Aquasave, I'd actually done a lot of research on it myself. And I read here on a thread that someone had actually phoned the company and it didn't contain iodine. Although it may be a different type of Aquasave that contains iodine, I don't know. But it's better to be safe than sorry. In actual fact, I actually had a bottle of this other Aquasave on the way. But after watching her video and seeing the urgency on the matter, I decided to go buy some today. So basically, I'm going to have double everything. Next up, I was using fin rot and fungus control. And the better option is methylene blue. I knew methylene blue was the better option, but the supplier told me this is okay too. But I'm going to stop using this just in case.

Some cool things about this bomber plane is the fact that this plane can actually take off in about a second or two which is pretty cool. This plane also comes with bombs but the bomb capacity on this plane is around 50. This plane also has four engines which pretty much helps the plane go really quick. A neat feature about this plane is the fact that when you're flying at a certain height you can go off the radar. I only have two issues with this plane. The first issue with this plane is the fact that it takes up so much space in your hangar. I mean look at this you guys can see that it removed all of my planes and literally it doesn't make any sense.

If it was, we wouldn't be allowed to use it. It'd be much harder to purchase legally. You could just walk up to any vitamin shop or GNC and ask for creatine. They'll gladly sell it to you. No matter the form of creatine that is taken, its primary function is to increase the phosphocreatine source that are found in your muscles, and by doing so, you're also increasing the amount of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, that is produced. Long story short, supplementing with any form of creatine will cause a natural increase in your athletic performance. Now, I'm sure everyone wants to know, is creatine safe for teenagers? I get this question every day. Quite frankly, I think it is, but don't take my word for gospel. Just consult a professional. What I can tell you, though, is if your mom and dad still don't want you purchasing creatine, try convincing them to allow you to eat more red meat and fish, because another fun fact, creatine is naturally found in these protein sources.

For me, that's my fastball, cutter, and changeup. See how they all start in the zone and they all finish in the zone? Strike pitches usually have less total movement, which makes them easier to tunnel. A chase pitch starts in the same tunnel as your strike pitches, but ends up as a ball.

Choose the right pan. A non-stick, cast iron, or griddle works really well for the job. For a delicious golden brown surface and nice tall cake, you need an even, medium heat. Pancakes aren't supposed to be fried. All you need is a little thin layer of vegetable oil. To evenly portion out the pancakes, use a measuring cup. I use a quarter cup for my pancakes. The batter is thick, so to create a perfect circle, just use the back of a spoon or offset spatula. Cook until the edges set and you start to see bubbles break through the surface. And also check for a golden brown underside. Now you're ready to flip. To prevent the raw batter from smearing all over the pan, just hold the spatula about three inches above the pan and do a quick turn. Tip number seven, do not press down with the spatula. You're going to press out all those gorgeous air bubbles, resulting in a really thin and chewy pancake. Tall and fluffy is what we want.  ->","completion":" True."}

Five more sprays of laundry pre-wash and for the last ingredient, some water. Then top it off with two paper towels to let the case really soak in the ingredients.

Everything that you can see down there. Not the inside. You can wash your vulva with water. Just don't wash the inside of it. Wear cotton underwear so your vagina can breathe. Avoid smoking and don't drink as much. Use non-porous sex toys. Porous sex toys have little holes that can collect bacteria and give your vagina an infection. Drink more water. Just like your pee, if you don't drink enough water, it can become concentrated and smelly.

As a relationship therapist, I've literally spent my career studying the art of attraction and human psychology, so I know that these things work. The first thing you're gonna do is take advantage of the reciprocal liking concept. When you see them in person, you are gonna act so genuinely excited. Oh my God, I'm so excited to see you and catch up on all the things we talked about last time. You're probably thinking, but Kimberly, like, shouldn't I be playing it cool? Like, shouldn't I be waiting for them to come and talk to me? And the answer is absolutely not. You're gonna treat them like you have a very special connection, and this is because our brains are psychologically primed to like people more when we know that they like us and think we're a good person. This isn't even a flirty thing at all. This is literally that they feel safe and seen with you, and they know that you see the absolute best in them. Next thing you're gonna do, in your conversation, you are gonna point out something that is similar about both of you. Oh my gosh, I can't believe we both have a sister. Wow. The human brain does unconsciously choose people who we view as similar to us. Next thing, when people, especially men, see bearskin, they get aroused. I hate to admit it, but the sundress phenomenon is a real thing. There is a reason why guys like these so much. Your comfort is key when it comes to dressing in front of anybody, but if you wanna play it psychologically, it will not hurt you to show a little bit of bearskin. Finally, this is the kicker. If you are not in a relationship, you're going to make sure that you give other guys the time of day. This brings out a protective instinct in guys, and is usually the exact moment that they decide to lock it down.  ->","completion":" True."}

Like nasty, no self-awareness, in your face, rude. Did you know that there are some psychological ways to put a rude person in their place and make them wish they'd never spoken to you? As a therapist with a doctoral degree in psychology, I've spent my life studying human behavior and I know that if you do these three things, you're gonna have this rude person walking away with their tail between their legs. The most satisfying thing in the world. First thing you're gonna do, have you ever been in a situation where you're going about your day, everything's going amazing, and all of a sudden, somebody is rude to you out of the blue? They are rude to you for no reason at all and all of a sudden, your body starts to escalate. Your palms get sweaty, your heart starts racing, your pupils dilate. Most people are gonna feel that physical reaction and behave by either running away or getting angry themselves and wanting to fight back. But you're not gonna do that. You are gonna take a deep breath. You're not gonna say anything. This makes them feel deeply unsettled and puts them off their game right off the bat. Next thing you're gonna do. Now, this one's a little bit hard, but if you do it right, this person is going to be so embarrassed that they mess with you. Have you guys seen that clip of Tom Cruise on the internet where he's on the red carpet and this guy squirts water in his face? It's really, really rude and horrendous. If you've seen it, you know that Tom Cruise actually reacts in the most shocking way. He starts asking the person questions. Dude, why'd you do that, man? Hey, is everything okay? I'm giving you a nice interview. Why would you squirt water in my face? Asking questions calls out the behavior and brings attention to how ridiculous it is, making them look stupid. At this point of the interaction, they will feel shame. Finally, guys, this is the kicker. You are gonna remember that when someone is consistently rude, they are almost always looking for a dopamine hit. When they unload on you, it actually feels really good for them, especially if they see you physically deflate. If you turn your body away and keep your palms open, it actually asserts your true dominance and deprives them of the dopamine hit they want, so they get zero satisfaction.  ->","completion":" True."}

There are some really specific psychological and biological things that someone is gonna do when they like you that they don't even know that they're doing. As a relationship therapist with a doctoral degree in psychology, I've spent my life studying human behavior. So I know that these things are true. First thing you're gonna look for is eye tag. This is when you look over at them, catch them looking at you, and then they promptly look away. This is fully biological. They are looking at you because they can't help it. They like you and then they look away because they're embarrassed. Number two, this one's kind of gross, but you're gonna watch really closely for if they start, like, touching their face. When we get aroused as humans, we want to start touching our face. Our face becomes extra sensitive. So if you notice them touching their face a lot or even, like, sucking a straw a lot, they probably like you. You might also notice them touching their upper leg and hip. This is another sign that they're turned on because it's their body's way of subconsciously drawing your attention downwards. I'm serious. It's true. You're gonna pay super close attention to the direction of their feet. If they like you, their feet are gonna be pointed directly towards you. And if they don't like you, their feet are subconsciously gonna be pointing away from you. Number five is exclusion. If they like you, they're gonna try to exclude you and them from the rest of the group. Not in, like, a weird or creepy way. This is just because they want one-on-one time so that they can actually bond with you. They ever try to bring the conversation to, like, a sexy or romantic place. It's often because they're trying to find out if you like them. They want to talk about sexy things so that you will confess. If they talk about working out or what they did in the gym, they want you to notice their body. Number eight is called peacocking. This is when they boast a lot or just come across as really conceited. If this person likes you, they're probably gonna be a little bit of a peacock. But don't worry, it's totally natural and instant because they want to impress you. Finally, guys, this is the kicker. If they give you a long hug, it's over.

{"prompt":"#handyfacts #adulting101 #shower #tips | Young people often don't know how to take a shower. This makes sense when I thought about it because you're you're bathed as a baby. And then you get older and you're kind of bathing yourself with supervision, but people are telling you what to do. Then you get old enough where you're bathing without supervision and then you probably transitioned into a shower right from that stage with no supervision. So nobody's ever told you how to take a shower. So there's all these little shower tips that nobody's told anybody. And so, well, I'm telling you, so pay attention. One, you don't have a towel. You forgot your towel. Somebody took your towel, whatever it is, a t shirt. A t shirt works fine as a towel. You probably wore a dirty t shirt in and you've got a clean t shirt you're gonna wear. Use the dirty t shirt. No. It's not so stinky that that stink will transfer back onto you. It doesn't work that way. You'll be fine. Two, after you're done your shower, you're dripping wet. Don't just grab the towel and start absorbing all that water. Just use your hands and do a quick wipe down. You'll get, like, seventy percent of the water off your body and your hair, kinda like that. And you'll you'll get your towel less wet, which means you can use your towel more often won't promote mildew as much. There's all sorts of good things. Or if you're using a t shirt, it'll be better tip. Three, when you are washing your hair, the water, like imagine the the shower is coming down. You want it the the the the top, the crest the top part of the water should be landing against your skull, like, right there where the the two points are kind of in the back, and then the water will slow down perfectly down the back over here, and I won't get in your face. And then when you lather up, you can just tilt your head back to your hair wet and add lagged water, take water away, rinse it all off, and it won't get in your face, and it won't go blind from soap. Four, If you have a lot of facial hair or if you have parts of your body with a lot of body hair, it is possible that hair will require a different treatment. Than the hair on your head. This is an embarrassing pay attention to it because you may need specific shampoos for down under or facial hair or anything like that, and they make things like that. So pay attention. Five, if you're getting like kind of, like, little scabs on your scalp and you might be embarrassed by it. Like, what the heck is that? They don't bleed or anything. They just feel like scabs when you peel them off, they just come off and they're just There, that's dandruff. Okay? They always talk about the flakes with dandruff. They don't talk about that symptom in the commercials because I guess it's too gross. But that standard it just means you have dandruff. And honestly, ninety percent of people can be cured of dandruff using a basic dandruff shampoo. You don't have to buy the expensive stuff. Just try like, head and shoulders are the generic rate of head and shoulders, and it'll probably fix it for you. Do I have anything else? No. I think the oh, yeah. The soap. Get the soap. Give it a quick rinse beforehand because, you know, the person before you, you don't know what they were washing with that So so just I mean, two seconds of rinsing, but don't put it right on your body.  ->","completion":" True."}

{"prompt":"With great power comes great responsibility ;) #advice #tips #lifeadvice #psychology #lifetips #socialhacks #lifehacks #lifehack | Alright, here's how to never run out of things to say. Before I can explain, you need to understand this thing that's inside your head, and you don't even realize it. It's a phenomenon called the spotlight effect. It's a cognitive bias. So real quick, pretend that this is you. Because that's you, and you're human, then you have limitations. One of them is a phenomenon called the spotlight effect. See, because you're the center of your own world, you believe that you're being perceived more than you actually are. For example, say you're driving and you hit a red light. Then you probably think that everyone around you is staring right at you, but the truth is they're not. In your head, you think that you're being looked at way more than you actually are. Ffff- In a conversation, when you're talking to people and you slip up, you probably think, oh my god, everyone's looking at me, everyone's- no, no they're not. It's in your head, like you're not being- you're not as important as you think you are. To never run out of things to say, there's two secrets. The first one is family. Bring up family. It's been scientifically proven that when you talk about family, it builds a stronger rapport between the person. Don't force it, it can come across as aggressive, like, hey, how many brothers do you have? Like, no, don't do that. Make it natural. Something like, oh, I really like your shirt, that's something my sister would wear. Do you have any sisters? See, that's more natural.

My first tip, you've already heard it a thousand times, confidence. If you don't have confidence, fake it, hold your head up high and walk a little bit faster, that'll gain respect, give you attention, and you're hot, act like it. My second tip is to always leave the school dances early. If you don't have another place to go, go home, it doesn't matter, but people will wonder where you're going, and that'll gain you attention. My third tip is wear pink, wear tweed, wear feathers, wear fur, wear plaid, and wear tracksuits. Channel that Paris Hilton energy because you are the main character, and you're hotter than everyone else, or at least act like it. My fourth tip is to be fun, but be friendly, you can go crazy at parties, I don't care what you do, but be nice to everyone so that if you accidentally throw up on their rug, they won't hate you forever. Also, you want to be the talk of the town, but not the talk of the town in a bad way like Hitler. Sometimes you want to start a little drama, come to school with mascara running down your face, look like you just got broken up with, or just had a crazy night out. People will talk about you.

Well, it's a simple answer, and that is that third-party apps cannot support the thousands and thousands of different phones that come out on Android every single year. Because each phone that comes out on Android or has been out for a long time always has a different processor, a different camera, just different settings altogether. And these app developers don't have the time nor money to develop these apps that work great with every single phone. So they create a generic one that works across all Android devices, and it's terrible. All it is is actually just screen recording the viewfinder in your camera app. That's why you see such big frame drops and just overall bad video quality when compared to your native camera app. Is there a way to fix this? No, you just have to record it in your native camera app instead of a third-party app. And this has been an issue on Android phones since Android's been a thing.  ->","completion":" True."}

{"prompt":"Replying to @hosedude   A journey to the Surface of Last Scattering! Looking out in space is looking back in time. How far can we look? #astronomytok #spacetok #physicstok #astronomy  | So this is a picture of the beginning of the universe. It's a picture of shortly after the beginning. Yeah. That's ridiculous. What do you mean? Dude, listen to yourself. How can we have a picture of something that happened so long ago. But what did someone travel through time to take this? Basically. Yeah. Oh my god. Dude, I'm afford it for you. No need to be, man. Look, just hear me out on this. Light moves at a speed, the speed of light. Right? Yeah. So the farther away something is from you, the longer it must take for its light to reach you. Right? Yeah. If you think about it then, you're never really seeing anything as it is right now, but as it was in the past because light takes time to get places. Now, light is insanely fast. It could circle the earth seven times in one second. So for all and purposes everything close by is as it is right now. But lights travel time becomes increasingly significant again, the further and further out you look. Okay. So for instance, it takes light about one second to get from the moon to the Earth. So when we look at the moon, we are seeing it as it was one second ago. The sun's light takes about eight minutes to reach us. So we see the sun as it was eight minutes ago. Wow. We see the nearest star to the sun as it was four years ago. And the nearest major galaxy to ours as it was two and a half million years ago. I can't even process that. We're just warming up, dude. With modern telescopes, we've now observed a plethora of galaxies so distant that we see them as they were billions of years ago. That is a significant fraction of the entire age of the universe ago. And something interesting happens when we observe of especially distant objects like that. We noticed that the further out we look, the simpler everything becomes, simpler clear? Yeah. It's a clear trend that progressively distant galaxies are on the whole not as massive and less developed than those that are closer by. Okay. And that's exactly what you'd expect because by looking out that far we are looking at earlier moments in cosmic history. When the universe and all of its contents were younger and less evolved. Time machines exist, dude. They're called telescopes. And when we use them, we become time travelers. Watching the history of the universe unfold right before our eyes. That is amazing. It's the coolest thing ever. We can look so far out into space and back in time that we eventually reach a point where stars and galaxies didn't even exist yet. We can look at a time when the universe was so young that it lacked any kind of structure at all. We have a picture of that time. It's that one. That is the universe as it was about four hundred thousand years after it began. Long before the formation of any celestial object, specifically a photo of what we call the surface of last scattering, and it is the farthest thing that we can ever possibly see. What?

Oh, it's just a baby picture of the universe, the CMBR. CMBR? Yeah, man. The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. It's the very first light that was ever released into the universe. See, this image is a projection of the entire sky, showcasing the most ancient light in existence, which is coming from all directions at all times from the very edge of the visible universe. What? The light you're seeing here was emitted when the universe as we know it was just a few hundred thousand years old, meaning that this light began its journey to us before the Earth had even formed. Heck, before the Milky Way galaxy had even formed. It then traveled through space for over 13.5 billion years, losing energy as it did so due to the expansion of the universe, which slowly stretched it into low-energy microwave light by the time that it finally landed on our telescopes. Now, the place from which all of this cosmic radiation was released is formally called the surface of last scattering. And not only is it the farthest thing in space that we've ever seen, it's the farthest thing that we can ever see. It's the edge of the visible universe. Dude, stop. I am so lost.

So the German the the German government decides, alright, this is incredible. This could work in the home front. So what we're gonna do is put the perfect in into chocolate. Right? And we're gonna send it out into the fucking grocery stores. Try to try to advertise it to German housewives. Right? But you take some of this chocolate. Right in the morning. Right? Instead of coffee, you're gonna take some meth chocolate. Right? It's gonna get y'all picked up and then you clean the house at fucking mock ten. Right? So it started to get really popular in Germany. Right? And then evil mustache man, along with his generals, find out that some of his soldiers had actually been taking fervent before they invaded Poland. Just some of them on their own volition. Right? So the German military gets this fucking idea. They say, what if we make Perveton, a mandatory part of the German soldiers rations. Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna take the purposing. We're gonna put it into chocolate, and we're gonna we're gonna give it to them. Right? And now the tank cruise, they came up with a new nickname for this with this meth chocolate.

When the enormous man of immense physical strength was just a child, he was enslaved by a local official in Egypt. But suspected of theft, he was thrown out of the house and left to fend for himself in the streets. Turning to a life of crime, he fell in with a notorious band of thieves, and proving exceptionally useful in a fight, was quickly made the leader of the 75 men. When he once went to rob a house in the middle of the night, he swam across the crocodile-infested waters of the Nile River while holding a sword in between his teeth. But when the homeowner's dog alerted the man to his presence, he was hunted down by the local authorities, and forced to hide in a monastery to escape. When the monks found him, he was so impressed by their kindness they became a brother himself, and it's said that so sudden a conversion from vice to virtue was never before witnessed. Walking 20 miles a day while fasting in the hot sun to bring water to his elderly brethren, he became known as one of the Desert Fathers, some of the most important figures in the early church. And it's said that his dedication to defeating demons was so great, he would even sleep standing up without closing his eyes. Rising to lead dozens of men, he told his followers, You fast, but Satan does not eat. You labor tirelessly, but Satan never sleeps. The only dimension in which you can outperform Satan is humility, for Satan has none. When he turned 75, a second group of robbers advanced upon his monastery, this time in unbeatable numbers. But ordering the other monks to flee, he stayed behind, saying he wished to fulfill the Lord's teaching that those who live by the sword shall perish by it.

Whenever the recipe requires a mixture of flour, I just use all purpose. It's called all purpose for a reason, along with the teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda. We also like adding in a teaspoon of espresso powder to enhance the chocolate flavor. So in a separate bowl, we'll go with a cup of brown sugar. Half a cup of white sugar. I love espresso powder, so I'm adding a little extra. And the best picky dough consistency uses one egg yolk mixed with one regular egg. The dessert MSG, one egg, one egg yolk, leg a fork until smooth, add in the butter. You can beat this on the couch if you want, but I'll just do it here. Combining the dry ingredients with the wet mixture. Combine the dry ingredients and wet ingredients in a satisfying way. You just keep of chopped chocolate in addition to smaller chips to create the perfect wells of gooey goodness. And I also know that you like the chocolate snapping sound. I'm gonna eat what you want. After we fold the chocolate into the dough, we roll them into perfect looking balls. So most of it away in the freezer and then bake four of them. Three fifty, four fourteen minutes. The large size of the chocolate chunks kinda makes it look like a mess made by a baby, but I'm sure by the end, it will be more satisfying as well. Let's do what it did in the beginning and split open multiple cookies at once. Yeah. A bite out of these will max out my dopamine level. Let's give it a taste in raid o n thirteen. I think I nailed this one. Crunchy on the outside, chewy and gooey on the inside. The only issue is that it doesn't look that good. So nine point five out of ten. But again, I've never had a chocolate chip cookie that didn't taste good. I've also never had a chocolate chip cookie that didn't have a glass of milk to go with it. Even though it's expired for a few days, but it tastes fine. Alright. Thank you.  ->","completion":" True."}

When you notice her getting bored, grab your phone and check it for about half a minute, as if you're reading something with a serious expression on your face. Afterward, quickly stand up with a worried, concerned expression and tone and tell her, I'm sorry, I'll be right back. And boom! What seemed like a boring date suddenly becomes a spike of anxiety. Now she's going to wonder what happened. Did someone get hurt? Is someone coming for you? Am I in danger? What should I do? And you know what's the best part? After a minute or so, you come back with a drink or snack, looking calm and happy and say, here you go. Confused, she might ask, is everything all right? Then you calmly look into her eyes and say, now it's 10 billion times better. And the stage is set. She now has a deeper emotional connection with you because you made her feel anxious for a moment and then relieved that anxiety. Additionally, you made her feel that she was useful to you by making you feel better about her being there. Three rabbits with one stone. She won't be forgetting this date for some time.

{"prompt":"How to go VIRAL doing YouTube Automation #youtubeautomation #youtube #sidehustle #viral  | Isn't it insane that this channel got over 2 million views on their very first upload? The crazy thing is that they didn't achieve this by chance. They follow a structure that works every time. The algorithm doesn't give a shit about subscribers or followers. Watchtime is the most important statistic you have when it comes to how you edit your video. This is where the leading question structure comes into play. The leading question structure isn't something most content creators want you to know about, but why should you trust me? Well, I run over 300 channels and have built an entire company around running channels with this exact structure, so trust me when I say that I know exactly how the algorithm works. Let's have a look at this channel, JumpShot. Their first upload has accumulated over 2 million views in just 8 months. This particular video starts with a crazy statement that makes people have a leading question and makes them want to keep watching the video because they need to know the answer. The creator wants the viewer to always have a question in their mind that gets answered very quickly. However, that answer has to then provide the viewer with another question to ponder, creating a chain of questions that keeps them watching the video. The watchtime will skyrocket and we all know YouTube loves that. This is only one part of the content creation process though, alongside the triangle of content creation which I uncovered in my last video. If you want more details, leave a comment and I'll make another video with all the answers you seek.  ->","completion":" True."}
{"prompt":"6 Manipulative hacks that most people dont know.???#manipulation #advice #foryoupageofficiall #fyp #foryoupage #trending  | 6 manipulative hacks that 95% of people learn too late. 1. Confusing people is always the best strategy. If someone insults you, pause for a second and look at them and say, Are you okay? Works every time. 2. If you think someone is lying, look at their eyes and don't say anything. 3. If you're in an argument, keep your voice calm. It'll give them the impression that you're winning the argument. 4. Good posture increases confidence. Spread your body out and take up more space. It'll lead to increased confidence. 5. Open with, I need your help. People don't like the guilt of not helping someone out. When asking for a favor from someone, begin your request by saying, I need your help. It greatly increases your chances of getting that favor done. 6. If you want someone to agree with you, nod while you talk. This gets the other person to nod too, and they begin to subconsciously think they agree with you. These are some of the manipulative hacks that most people don't know until it's too late. They can help you confuse, persuade, or dominate others, but they can also backfire or be immoral. Use them sparingly and responsibly.  ->","completion":" True."}

The man was so scared that he closed his eyes tightly and didn't dare to breathe. But to his surprise, the snake just gave him a kiss on the forehead. Then it slowly retreated again. The man took a closer look and realized. It was the same little snake he had saved years ago. Ten years ago, the man found a snake egg in a cave. He took it home and incubated it carefully. Soon the baby snake emerged from its shell. It was then that the boy realized. He had rescued a very rare golden and silver python. He saw that it had such a beautiful pattern on its body. The boy couldn't get enough of him. He named him Lisa. But it didn't last long. Daniel's father soon found out about the snake. The father was very much against the idea. He was about to snatch the snake and kill him. But Daniel was quick to run. He escaped from the house just in time. To protect his beloved snake, Daniel went to the river. He was about to release him back into the wild. But the snake loves Daniel. He wouldn't leave. The boy was ready to let him go anyway. Just then. There were shouts from the villagers behind him. They were all looking for Daniel. But just then. A strange scene occurred. Small snakes were suddenly crawling out of the water. They were slowly approaching the crowd. In order to keep Daniel and the villagers out of harm's way. She turned around and went back into the water. With Lisa gone. All the snakes on the ground returned. Ten years had passed.

So I was, like, can you just drop this off at the shop? Made sure he had the right address. I sent it on its merry way with the keys. All good. It's fine.

Be playing a little league as a kid. Be all the way out in the out feel didn't see shit and be like, hey guys, are we still playing? And school is even worse. The teacher would be like, do all these math problems on the chalkboard. Of course, I'm sitting a hundred thousand miles away, directly in the fucking hallway. Like, there's a chalkboard in here. My parents would take me to the doctor and they'd be like, our kid keeps running into walls. We think he's autistic. And the doctor was like, well, he's not autistic. He just can't fucking see anything. Why doesn't he have glasses yet? And I was like, shut your mouthhold, man. I don't want any of these goddamn glasses. When they test our vision in school, I would just wait and have a bunch of kids go ahead of me and just memorize what they would say when they'd read off the chart. Next person, Ez y x w v u t. Boom. You can all suck it. I can see just fine. The charts over there. So I go to the shitty ASI doctor. And if you've never been to the eye doctor before, then you don't know what hell on earth is. And one of the first tests they put you through is for glaucoma, and the doctors like put your chin up on this machine here and we're gonna shoot a little puff of air into your eyeball. Okay. You'll barely feel anything. Alright. Let's do the next die. Then they throw their torture chamber device on your head, start making a REIT stuff. Alright. Tell me what you see. Like, well, I still don't fucking see anything. But I feel obligated to at least make a guess like I'm playing some shitty Carnival game. Gonna give me an oversized stuffed gorilla if I get them all right. I'm like, am, a lowercase q, the at symbol, a goomba from Super Mario World. How am I doing, doc? You got them all right. Yay. No. Not even close. I was clearly blind this shit. They put me out in the waiting room and I'm looking at all these frames on the wall and I'm thinking, well, if I gotta wear glasses, I might as well go for the Jeff Gold them look. Because because he was fly a shit. And the doctor's like, easy there, sunny. Your family's insurance only covers these frames. And he points to one lonely shelf the most hideous glasses you've ever seen in your life, ones with double bridge frames in there. So your glasses won't break when the kids throw rocks at you. Glasses that would be bigger than kids book bags at school. I can't feel my nose. Well, that's because your fucking glasses are fourteen pounds. I'm like, oh, thanks a lot, doc. I said I said Jeff Goldboom, not fucking Jeffrey Dahmer. I'm not wearing these glasses, mom and dad. I'm gonna get kicked in the balls. Zachary gets kicked in the balls every day at school. Fuck that. I'll keep catching baseballs with my face before that happens. My parents are over there trying to make me feel better. Wow. You definitely look a lot smarter.

You don't know what an airsoft gun is? Well, it's a plastic gun that kind of bridges the gap between a Nerf gun. And a semi automatic rifle. It's your little plastic babies. And after about a week, your whole house is littered with them. Your dad's dumping them out of the toaster. Your sister's digging them out of her ass crack. Just go around shooting a bunch of holes and all the lampshades. And I was the first kid on my block to get in there. So Got it. Out to show off to everybody. They're all mesmerized. I could conquer the whole goddamn world with this thing. My buddy, Dave, literally, took it out of my hand. And he's like, oh, sweet. This is sweet. David, what the fuck? It was my turn to shoot Mike on the face. It was a bit of a trendsetter I gotta say. He because, like, a week later, every kid on the block had an air soft gun. They didn't have a normal air soft gun like I did. They had this fucking battery powered M16 tactical shit. Fully automatic. Get shot in the face thirty times and four seconds. A lot of damn minutes. Jesus. I'm using this stone age piece of crap. My shit looks like a happy meal toy compared to yours. Michael's over there. Doesn't even have an airsoft gun.

Get home with a bunch of red welts all over body like somebody gave you a small pox blanket. I eventually upgraded my arsenal through my hand gun out and purchased a big old sniper rifle. Things bigger than my entire body. Big ass scope on top of it like I was gonna assassinate a public official here didn't shoot fast like the other ones, but the thing had some power. My friends hiding behind a car and shit. I just shoot through the fucking car. First weekend, I got that rifle. Shout my cousin in the back. The following weekend, we had a closed casket funeral form. Now on one particular day, we were playing capture the flag. It's important to note at this time. They didn't put the big ass orange tips on these guns like they do nowadays. Let you know it's a fake gun. No. It just dab a bit of orange nail polish on the end of that bitch, call it a day. And that kind of makes it a little hard for your neighbors to determine if you're outside playing or if you're committing an act of domestic terrorism. Yeah. Hi. Nine one one. There's a child with a dear rifle and he's running a muck in the streets. I'm sitting there at my base, which is David's front yard. I'm peeking through my scope like I'm about to put Linden b Johnson into office. And I'm on the lookout for David. Where's David at? Well, David has ADHD. So he's not at his base, and he's not at my base. Well, I don't even know if he even knew he was playing at the time. But I forgot all about it, chasing a butterfly in shit. Now, David decides to walk to one of the busiest streets in the city and wave around what looks to be an automatic assault rifle in there. Imagine David's surprise. And about four seconds later, goddamn Patty wagon pulls up in front of him. A bunch of cops pile out. They got their guns drawn on this completely oblivious attention deficit child. I wasn't there. I was around the block waiting to shoot David in the teeth with my Kennedy killer, but I bet that turd in his pants. Was massive. It didn't take him long to figure out that David's gun wasn't real. Luckily, he wasn't massacred on the street right there and then loaded his ass in the back of a wagon, like a wild animal that he is, and they pull up to the front of his house. Now, it's there for this part. And I can say for sure that the turd in my pants was masked. One cop gets out and he's like, put that goddamn rifle down. So I threw it, like the gun was on fire. Dave comes out of the back of the truck, looking like shitty dentist, the men's car too. How do you think you guys are doing? We're just lying. Why is that kid wearing that puppy ass coats? Ninety four degrees outside? They was mom comes running out like they're filming an episode, a lawn order in front yard. Instead of getting a chance to meet iced tea, she's gotta deal with this bullshit. Now, the cops are really cool about this whole shitty situation. They gave David's mom our arsenal of plastic weapons. And they're all like, well, we could've murdered your kid and got away with it, but, well, we didn't so you're welcome.

It was more like just a bunch of eleven year olds being the hell out of each other, but we did the best we could. And to make matters worse, we did this in my a friend David's front yard. So we are on full display in front of the whole neighborhood. There'd be people walking down the street. Oh my god. Those kids are gonna hurt themselves. Oh well. Before a bunch of kids, we were actually pretty professional. I mean, we had like a referee, the chief styrofoam championship belts you got from Kmart. How even add a boom box out there to play your entrance music. Here, put my CDN and play track five. What the hell is this shit? What? What are you guys looking at? It's the only CDI app. Austin three six eight. Give me a hell. Yeah. So that once we were in the ring, I mean, the front yard, I guess. We would proceed to just beat the hell out of each other. Anyway, we could. And of course, we would get hurt. Mean hell, to this day, I get back spasms because of the one time I tried to do a missile drop kick off the fence, got forbid, but it was worth it. Be out there trying to imitate your favorite wrestler. Mine of course was Dwayne the Rock Johnson. Not not this Dwayne the Rock Johnson. I don't know who the hell this I'm talking this one. The old one. The Duane, do you smell what the rock is cooking, Johnson? I'd be out there saying one liners left and right. Do you smell what the rock is cooking? Just bring it, get your prony. There'll be people like walking their dog and shit. Why is that sixty five pound white kid keep calling himself the rock? I have no idea. And what the fuck is a Jabronie? Now, of course, if you're a wrestler, you have to have your very own finishing move. And my finishing move was called the Crippler Cross Face. How you do the crippling cross faces, you yank back on somebody's head really hard until they tap out or you snap their neck and you cripple them for life. Hence the name, the crippling cross face. And there was nobody I like doing that move to more than my next door neighbor, Michael. Because Michael was a dirty fighter. He was tripping shit, spit on your face while you're down in care. So he deserved every crippling cross face that he got. I mean, down there talking shit to him while I'm doing it. I'm the prom of both bitch. On the prom a ball. So you let him go when the match is over, but Michael's all but hurts still, so he kicks you in the ball. That's my fucking finish and move. How you like that? Winter and champion. Give me a hell. Yeah. And like I said, we would always rest David's front yard. But there was one time in particular, we decided to wrestle in this restaurant's parking lot that was across the street. Now, why would we wrestle in a busy parking one. Well, because we're dumbass eleven year olds. That's why. And dumbass eleven year olds do dumbass things like wrestle in a busy parking lot. So we have this street match, if you will, and it's between David and Michael. Now you had to watch out for David because David would do this really cool finishing move where he'd take your legs and then bend you backwards until your asshole touched the back of your head. It did not feel good, and I did not wanna be a part of it whatsoever. So they start going at it. And since Michael what it was. Dave has got him on the ground in about thirty seconds. Hey, if they met before, what? Because who met before. Your asshole in the back of your head. Allow me to introduce too. So there we are. In the middle of this restaurant parking lot, Michael's bent in half. He's crying like he got shot by a fucking rifle. Of course, some guy in his car sees us and he's like, what the hell is this?

Her dog and her baby are always together, and every day her dog ups up on her baby's chair to sit with them, so she made sure to record it and it's adorable. Safe to say these two have become best friends. When they were feeding her chips like a dog, their dog was watching this starting to get jealous. And when he thought it was now his turn, but they were giving it to her again, he pulled out a WWE body slam. This doll goes around a farmer's market and shops for its owner. You can see her touching the food she wants, and then the store owner will put it in her basket. She then picks it up and brings it to the next one and does the same. She's even walked up to a stranger and taps on them to get their attention so she can get some oranges for her basket. After the store owner gets her some, the dog then tells them she needs some little oranges. There have been moments of miscommunication though. When she went to get some oranges from this worker, she tapped on the horn she wanted and the worker gave her a few different ones. She then points at it again saying she wants this horn specifically and the worker says no. So she grabs the orange anyway, puts it in her basket like she'll just take it herself then and walks away. Every time they play this song, their dog starts doing a moonwalk. Every time they play this song, their dog does this. She brought her dog over to her dad's where he has a rooster and they immediately became best friends playing tag. The rooster would chase her dog around the wooden palettes, and the rooster would even play it smart by switching directions to try and catch her. There was even a funny moment where they didn't know where each other was for a moment, and the dog peaked around the corner and then jumped at the rooster scaring him. And the game of Tag continued. After she left her dad's and didn't return for several months, she thought they might forget each other until they met gan and instantly started playing together, an unexpected friendship that will go on forever. Ever since her dog named Kodo was a puppy, he'd find a stick to carry home from his walk. And years later, he hasn't changed. Only the size of the stick, even trying to bring home an entire tree branch.  ->","completion":" False."}

{"prompt":"#fouryou #movies #fyp  | A spoon-shaped alien creature suddenly appeared above Earth. He travels 2 million light-years just to find his own kind in the universe, but past experience proves that he is a unique existence. Just then, a blue planet appeared before his eyes. He quickly flew over the Earth and opened his third eye, carefully searching for objects on the ground. Soon, a spoon appeared in his view. The aliens are extremely excited because spoons are everywhere on Earth. He immediately activated his superpower and sucked them all in. For a moment, spoons all over the world broke free from gravity and uncontrollably released. For most regions, not being able to eat with a spoon is a disaster. Some military experts speculate that this could be an alien attack on Earth, attempting to starve humans to death by taking away the tableware for eating, but the female professor felt that humans should not initiate war on their own initiative, because aliens currently exhibit abilities that have a perfect chance of controlling something else. If it wasn't a spoon but a nuclear bomb that was sucked away, the harm caused by that goes far beyond that. In response to this crisis, some manufacturers have quickly launched milk that can be consumed without a spoon. At the same time, more and more spoons are flying away from Earth. Then some semi-finished spoons flew away through the roof. The weather forecast originally broadcast on TV has become a prediction of the flight direction of the spoon. At this point, a man looked at the magnificent scene before him, he couldn't help but grab a spoon, that's it, he was taken directly into outer space. At this moment, this alien is passionately kissing these fellow creatures living on outer planets. The man couldn't help but live stream on his phone and tell him, a spoon is just a type of metal tableware. Spoon star man remains unmoved, instead, using superpowers to control the spoon, formed a body size of his own. He finally found his girlfriend, and then happily left the Earth. Watching this distant alien, the man quickly asked, what should humans do without spoons? The alien turned around and suddenly gave a seductive smile. This man's stomach suddenly enlarged, he's pregnant, and the baby turned out to be a large spoon.  ->","completion":" False."}

{"prompt":"Being Broke #fyp??viral    #brewstewfilms    #brewstew   #foryou   #viral   #funny  #funnyvideos  #funnytiktok | Alright. Being poor sucks. I wouldn't recommend being poor. I've been poor for most of my life. I've been living on my own since I was seventeen years old. I was seventeen. I live with my roommate brewer in a duplex. Now that right there should give you an idea of how much money we had. We couldn't even rent a whole house. We run at half a house. Our landlord's like, you guys get the top part. This random stranger gets the bottom part. You guys share a basement and make awkward conversation from time to time. You got it? Alright. Cool. And let me say our asses were broke living in that new place. I was so broke. If I found a nickel on the ground, I wouldn't just put it in my pocket. I'd bust out my wallet. And put that baby in there nice and secure. You're not going anywhere. I could buy out half a tosy role with you and there's nothing quite like being hungry and having no money. Just be sitting there sometimes. Well, we have no money until we get paid on Friday. What day is it? It's Tuesday. Well, looks like we're fucked. We had a good run. I guess it's time to kill ourselves. Yeah. I was thinking the same thing. What's the cheapest way to not feel hungry when you have no money? I'll tell you what it is. It's going to sleep. Just take your ass to bed. You can't feel hungry when you're asleep. Now can you? So you're using a cheat code. Alright. I'm gonna sleep for the next three days until we get paid again. Way me up when we can eat. There's one time we scavenged the whole house, checking underneath all the furniture for any loose change, and somehow we manage to scrape together a decent amount of money, and we were able to buy a whole box of hamburger helper. Oh, yeah. We're gonna eat good tonight. We're the grocery store frolicking down the aisle. We're dumping all our change on the counter. Like the cashier just hit a jackpot on a slot machine. We get home and brewer decides to cook this hamburger helper in what looks like the oldest, most decrepit pan I've ever seen in my life. It's got rust marks on it. All crusty and shit. This damn thing looked like he salvaged it from the Titanic. He serves it up and there's like these black speckles mixed in the food. Like, what is this? Pepper? Did you put pepper in this? No. It wasn't pepper. Spoiler alert. It was like the metal coating on the pan that scraped off mixed in with the food. Well, that's gross. What are we supposed to do now? And I'll tell you what we did. We ate it anyways. Not much of a choice there now was it. This tastes like soot in metal. Yeah. It sure does. Be people on fear factor that wouldn't even need this shit. And we're over here getting seconds. That's really not that bad. If you close your eyes and try to think of something else, if we weren't worried about food being on the table, we definitely were worried about getting utilities shut off every month and get a disconnection notice in the mail. For the gas, for the electric, for goddamn utilities, you didn't even know existed. You get a knock on the door. You're a high oxygen company. We're here to shut your shit off. Oxygen company. What the hell? Bring in the vacuum. We had our gas shut off for a whole summer one time. No more warm showers no more drier. That gas oven in your kitchen. Well, that just turned into extra counter space. That's what that is. We're not paying the gas bill. What are you crazy? Most people like having a functioning oven in their kitchen, you know. Some people even see it as a necessity. But us, no. We didn't need that gas oven. Just got an electric toaster oven and put it right on top of our old oven. There we go. Problem solved. Now we can make our toasters pizzas again. We had our water shut off for a week one time. Guess what? Now you got no working toilet. Where are you supposed to shit now? Smartie pants? If you have ever had the joy of having your water shut off, then you know that you have one remaining flush in that tank on your toilet You're better making count. So let's do some quick poop math. You could probably take like four shits in that thing and maybe like, I don't know, twenty he pisses before things start breaking the crest of the rim. So everybody in the house rushes to go to the bathroom, like it's the last helicopter out of Vietnam. Everybody, get in here. We're making the most out of this last flush. Now you can still use your toilet if you dump some water bottles in the tank, manufacture your own flush there. One time, I didn't have any water bottles, but I did have an old two liter of flat mountain dew sitting there in the kitchen. And I got to thinking, that'll work. Right? Why wouldn't it? There I am. Dumping mountain dew into a toilet tank so I can poop in it. It was probably at this moment in my life where I was like, man, I should really get my life sorted out. This is not how I pictured my life to bait. And while we're on this subject of pooping when you're poor, what are you supposed to wipe with when you got three nickels in your wall? Because toilet paper sure is shit as a luxury at that point in your life. I've wiped my ass with so many different substances from not having proper toilet paper gonna write a book on it. How to poop when you're poor. What to wipe with? What to flush with? I'm talking McDonald's, napkins, coffee filters. Start looking at how fluffy the cat is thinking, hey, you know what? There's a possibility if worse comes to worse. The cat's hiding under the couch and shit and no something's up. You're not wiping with me, buddy, no sir rate. But having the water or the gas shut off, that wasn't that big of a deal to us. We can deal with that. We'll make do. But where I draw the line is the Internet. We tried to pay that bill as best we could, but no matter how hard we'd try, we still got our Internet shut off probably about fifteen times be sitting there one day, trying to log into your MySpace, and you get one of these bad boys pop up on your browser. Oh, god, damn it. We don't have any Internet. What is this? Pakistan? How am I supposed to switch around my myspace top eight. I still have Tom in there for Christ's sake. Everybody's gonna think I'm some kind of loser. I won't gladly shit in some mountain do, but I will be damned if I don't have any Internet.  ->","completion":" False."}

{"prompt":"My Dad&#x27;s Car #fyp??viral   #brewstewfilms   #brewstew  #foryou  #viral  #funny  #shorts #funnyvideos | Alright. Now, we didn't have a lot of money when I was growing up, which meant we had some pretty shitty family vehicles when I was a kid. And when I say shitty, I mean, they look like cars that would be ran over by a monster truck shitty. We had cars with broken windshields. They'd have more rust on them than the Titanic because my dad love cheap cars. The cheaper, the better. No matter how shitty they are, I'd be sitting there in pasture's seat. Dad, why is that car on fire? Oh, it does that from time to time. It's just a little oil. It's fine. But I was used to as a kid. I remember riding in one of my his parents' car. My mind was blown. It was like, whoa. You guys have air conditioning. What are you guys from the future? But of all the shitty cars that we had, they were nothing compared to my dad's nineteen eighty four Subaru hatchback. I called it the rusty turd because well, because it looked like it came from somebody's asshole. That's why first time I've seen this thing. I remember thinking holy hell. Did my dad build his own car? Why don't he take the fucking lawn mower apart and make this thing in the garage? This thing was no Rolls Royce. Let me tell you. It was a stick shift, but it had no third gear. But my dad didn't care. Third gear. Who the fuck needs third gear? Dad, are we even allowed to drive this thing on the road? Don't know. But we're gonna find out, god damn it. We'd be driving down the road. People would be staring at us. Nami, look, that man's driving a car made out of garbage. Now another thing about this car was that the passenger door, like the randomly opened while you're driving down the road. So you'd be sitting there trying to roll down your window all of a sudden, your ass goes tumbling down the highway. So my dad fixed it by keeping it held shut with a bungee cord. There we go. Good as new. No problem. I'd be sitting there nervous as hell. How many seatbelts do we got in this car? I don't think I have enough seatbelts. That car was a deathtrap. The goddamn thing didn't even have turn signals that were. Turn signals. Who the fuck dates turn signals? Just yell at my window if I have to. Hey, asshole, I'm gonna turn left up here. Can you hear me? My friends were totally afraid of our car. They hop in the back seat wearing helmets and shit. It's your are gonna blow up? Probably not, but have your mom sign this permission slip just in case. My dad paid one hundred dollars for this car, a hundred bucks. Dad, I don't think we should drive anything that costs less than a washing machine, but he loved it. He brag about it to his friends and shit. Yep. Bought this thing for a hundred bucks. It's less than me two years. It's like a four dollar a month car payment. Now the worst thing about this car was that the starter was broke. So that meant if we wanted to go somewhere, we'd have to push the car to get going and then jump in, pop the clutch, start the engine. That's what we'd have to do every time we wanted to go somewhere. So every day, we'd be out there pushing this car made out of garbage, like some kind of shitty two man Bob sled team. My friends would be watching this from the sidewalk. What kind the weird circus shit is this. It was pretty goddamn embarrassing to say, Elyse, we'd be at the grocery store. We will be staring at some shit. Oh my god. I hope they're pushing that thing off clip, but after two years, that Subaru had enough. The transmission was destroyed, and my dad had to tie it to a tree and put it down. Well, Rusty Turd, your time is up. Time to die. And that was the end of it. But there was good news after all that. My dad scraped that car and got even more money than any pay for it. Yeah. We're just giving you this money so we don't have to see that pile of shit on the road anymore. Have a good day.  ->","completion":" False."}
{"prompt":"#dog #dogs #dogsoftiktok #puppy  | This woman is opening her own vet clinic and during construction, they were doing a concrete sidewalk that leads to the front door. So to make it unique, she decided to have her dog walk on it so his footprints would lead customers to the front. Something that her dog will leave behind forever. But at the end, she didn't expect him to take off running down it. She was taking her dog named Whiskey on a walk when her dog kept pulling her chasing after something. She couldn't figure out what Whiskey was trying to run after until she finally just let her off the leash and then realized that she was trying to catch the moon. She said, it was the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my life. Her dog kept asking to go outside during the thunderstorm so she finally just let him out and this happened. You wanted to go out, now go. Safe to say he won't ask again. While she was dancing in the kitchen, her dog came over and started to dance with her. Almost doing the same moves that she was, as if her dog was copying her dance. There you go, Bailey. After one of her dogs passed away the day before, she went outside to feed her other dog and when she came back out, she saw him trying to bury his food where his brother was buried and was sobbing the whole time. A heartbreaking video showing the true emotions dogs have. After her dog passed away from cancer, people always ask her why she hasn't fixed her couch. But she said it reminds her of her dog because this was her favorite spot to lay down. Every single morning when she would come downstairs, her dog named Nellie would be at the bottom waiting to greet her and would be so excited to see her every day. Even if Nellie wasn't feeling good, she would always be there. But as Nellie got older, she started suffering from dementia and other physical problems and would sometimes forget her routine. On her last day alive, Nellie was still by the stairs. After she passed away, nothing prepared her owner for the first day Nellie wouldn't be there waiting for, missing her best friend. Her dog is extremely scared of fireworks so on 4th of July, his mom put on headphones for him to block out the noise and then played some dog videos. And he seemed super happy with the setup. Her chicken seen the gate open and saw an opportunity to run away until it got caught and had to run back.  ->","completion":" False."}

You get all jealous, like, oh, cool. Look, he's got a Nintendo six before, and I'm over here with three Lincoln locks. Cool. And that kid to me was my friend David. He had pretty much everything he wanted as in. For example, David had a bunk bed in his room, but David was an only child. So what the hell does he need a bunk bed for? I didn't know all your stuffed animals needed in place asleep. God forbid. He had all the cool stuff. He could top whatever you had by far. You finally got that sweet holographic charizard, Pokemon card. Well guess what? He's got three of them and they're all autographed by a real life charizard. Suck on that. The dude had three razor mini scooters, three of them. You need three scooters for David? You have two legs on your body. You're not a goddamn millipede. You don't need multiple scooters to ride around on. Out of everything David had, the trampoline in his backyard was the best. The day he got it, all the kids in the neighborhood just marveled at it. We can bounce to the moon on this damn thing. And boy, did we? We jumped on that thing and jumped and jumped and jumped our little asses off. We did that for like a whole fifteen minutes. Alright. That was fun. Now, what do we do? How about we try to hurt each other? Oh, yeah. I was thinking the same thing. Let's let's play a game called drop kick. How do you play drop kit? Oh, here I'll show you. That was the name of our favorite game to play on the trampoline. Drop kit. Not the most clever name but I got the point across. Now I'm gonna teach you guys how to play a drop kick. Alright? Rule number one. Be a dumbass nine year old kid. Okay. Check. We got that. We all qualify. Rule number two, try to injure your friends as much as possible. Only using your feet. Keep them in the teeth. Keep them in the belly. Knock the air out of them. God. I think I'm gonna throw up. Do anything you can to try to hurt your best friend. You made somebody bleed? Cool. That's one point. Knock the tooth out. Hey, that's two points. Alright. I'll look at that there. Comatose on the ground. Well, guess what? You're the champion now. You'd have kids wearing steel toe boots. I got my baseball cleats on ready to ruin somebody's life. Mike would be over there in his bare feet so he could move faster. That's what he always said. I had to be agile. Yeah, Michael, because God forbid, your knock off Jordans are really gonna slow you down. Michael, put your goddamn shoes out for Christ saying you're freaking everybody out. Jeez, that's Christ. Well, at least cut your damn toe nails once in a while with your nasty Wolverine fee god, you're disgusting. Rule number three, don't touch the ground. Now chances were that at some point somebody would kick you off the train. Wane. But if you touch that ground, you are out. You're done playing drop kick for that round. Michael, you're on the ground. You're out. No, I'm not. I'm in. I can still play Michael, your leg is broken in half, dude. Sit this one out. You lost. Sometimes you get kicked and you get lucky and be able to grab onto the chain link fence, you're backwards slide down at like a cheese grater. You fall back on a trampoline, your back's bleeding like a gunshot wound. I'm still in. I'm in. Okay. Carefully you step at slippery. There's blood all over the place. Then you'd have kids like my buddy's little brother, Matt, who was like a whole forty eight pounds at the time. His ass was so light. He jumped up too high. Stiff breeze could carry him right over the fence. He had the hardest time playing dropkicks because there wasn't any weight classes when we played. It's a little mat there. He'd have to face off against somebody like got like Corey, who had the physique of a middle aged garbage man. He's got like a hotdog in one hand. Yeah. Let's get it off. Corey couldn't even jump in the air. There's no way he's getting his big airborne. So he just fallen his butt. Launch Matt in the stratosphere. It's a technical knockout. Matt is disqualified. He didn't touch the ground. Well, you're not supposed to be in outer space either. He's disqualified. He's done. Rule number four. This is the final rule of drop kick. Don't get hit. By the Big Rock. Now you might be asking yourself, Big Rock. What Big Rock? Well, as if a bunch of nine year olds throwing their bodies around like a circus act wasn't dangerous enough, you'd put a big sixteen pound guard rock on the trampoline. There you go. Now you gotta dodge this big ass bowling ball rock while people are trying to kick you in the forehead. That sounds fun. This thing's flying through the air, landing on people's toes. You'd be looking the wrong way. Big ass rock comes out of nowhere. It breaks your pelvis. Little Matt's face is totally filled with terror. Knows if he gets hit with that damn rock. He's gonna he's gonna explode that impact. That's what he's gonna do. He'd have David's mom come outside and check on us. Hey, Anna. You guys want some lemonade? No. Nobody. Oh, you boys and your silly games. You could have other kids from the neighborhood staring at from a distance. Oh my god. What are they doing? Hey, you guys wanna play drop kick.

Number 7 was up first and you guys went crazy over it but this one might top it. Don't worry, this one is all in one video. Unlike the first one, this painting has two numbers which prompted a problem. I had to figure out how I wanted to display MJ on the 2 and the 3 without it looking weird. I ended up making each individual number a separate image. For the 3, I did an iconic portrait of him dunking and then for the 2, I did one of him mid-shot.

Ironically, the two people for my series I picked first both have the same color scheme, red. I promise the next one won't be.
